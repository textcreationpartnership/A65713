            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>MY hearts deſire, and prayer to God</hi> in your behalf, is this, That you may fully be united to the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> And in purſuance of this paſſionate deſire, I have compoſed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe, containing a full Anſwer to
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:107117:3"/>all the ſcruples obſtructing your Communion with us, which I could meet with in the writings of our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren.</hi> And let me, <hi>O my Friends,</hi> entreat you by the love of God, and your own ſouls, of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is his body, and of her union, peace, edification; by your concern for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> in the general, and for the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion</hi> in particular, which, I hope, is very great; by all the motives which <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> affords to love, peace, unity; by all the bleſſings it doth promiſe to the <hi>promoters,</hi> and all the dreadful evils it doth threaten to the <hi>diſturbers</hi> of them; by the ſad experience you have had already of the moſt fatal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and by your preſent fears of a more dreadful iſſue of them: laſtly, by all that you are like to ſuffer in your ſouls and bodies, by refractory perſiſting in your Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; let me, I ſay, beſeech you on my bended knees, by all theſe weighty motives, to lay to heart what I have offered in this Book, and in this Preface ſhall farther offer to engage you to conform, and ſeriouſly to conſider of it, and act according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions it may miniſter unto you, as you will Anſwer your neglect to do ſo, at the <hi>great and terrible day of the Lord.</hi> Now the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I would humbly offer to you are either, 1.

<q>If notwithſtanding the evidence produced, <note place="margin">p. 289.</note> that <hi>Baptiſm by immerſion</hi> is ſutable both to the inſtitution of our Lord, and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and was by them ordained to repreſent our <hi>Burial with Christ,</hi> and ſo our dying unto Sin, <note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The ſaid Author ſhews that our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions do highly prejudice the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, <note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> that they gratify the <hi>Infidel</hi> and <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and ſcandalize the <hi>weak</hi> and doubting <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> that they miniſter to the advantage of the <hi>Papist,</hi> and to the prejudice of the true <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> that they are highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:107117:6"/>to the <hi>State;</hi> that they have a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence upon our ſelves, by promoting ſtrife, enmity, carnality, and all the evils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon them, by obſtructing the love, peace, unity, order and edification of the Church, and the benefit of our Prayers, by hindring the efficacy of the means of Grace, by depriving us of all the bleſſings of love and peace, and by endangering our eternal peace. And hence he ſtrongly doth infer,
<q>That if <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do not think it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that all theſe evils ſhould enſue, than that they ſhould comply, or bear with thoſe few ceremonies, <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> and ſcrupled expreſſions of our Liturgy, then muſt they in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſubmit to the commands of their <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</hi> And p. 29. he puts this ſerious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> Whether thoſe <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and thoſe expreſſions in our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which they at preſent ſcruple, be ſo plainly evil, and ſo unqueſtionably forbidden, that for preventing all theſe dreadful evils, they may not be complyed with?</q> adding,
<q>That if they be not ſo clearly and indiſpenſably evil, that theſe great ends of the promoting the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mens Souls, and the preventing of the forementioned evils, which do ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably enſue upon them, cannot hallow them; they cannot be excuſed from being acceſſary to thoſe evils which enſue upon their <hi>ſeparating</hi> from, and their dividing of the <hi>Church</hi> on theſe accounts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Diſſenters</hi> cannot rationally judge theſe things to be thus clearly and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly evil, or think it better that all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ſhould enſue, than that they ſhould ſubmit unto them, he ſeems convincingly to
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:107117:6"/>prove from theſe conſiderations:</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Chap. 6. §. 1. from <hi>p.</hi> 167. to <hi>p.</hi> 170.</note> That the duties of promoting Chriſtian love, peace, unity, and the edification of the Church, and the preventing of Diviſion, Schiſm, and the diſturbance of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are moral and eſſential duties which will admit no diſpenſation; ſo that it is the duty of all <hi>Christians</hi> to contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and ſtrive together with one Soul for the promotion of theſe duties, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the contrary evils.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly,<note place="margin">p. 176.</note>
               <q>That the preſerving of what is moſt eſſential unto the welfare of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the intereſts of piety, is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded than the omiſſion of what is only circumſtantial to them; and that precepts which concern only <hi>Rituals,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 46.</note> are to give place to thoſe which do concern the welfare of mens bodies, and much more to thoſe which do reſpect the welfare of our Brothers Soul; ſo that, when both cannot together be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, we muſt neglect or violate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to obſerve the latter.</q> Agreeably to which aſſertion, <hi>Divines</hi> do generally lay down this, as a certain rule concerning poſitive commands, requiring things which it is not intrinſecally evil to omit, <hi>viz. That all ſuch things ceaſe to be duties, when they are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistent with others of a greater conſequence,</hi> there being greater reaſon and obligation, when we cannot do both, to do the latter with the omiſſion of the former. And this that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth confirm,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the example of God himſelf, who ſuffered his own ceremonial inſtitutions to be neglected upon accounts of leſſer moment, <note place="margin">p. 171.</note> 
               <hi>viz. circumciſion</hi> for the convenience of his

            <p n="2">2ly, From the example and declarations of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who taught, that in all ſuch caſes, <note place="margin">p. 171, 172.</note> 
               <hi>God would have mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi> approved the action of <hi>David</hi> and his Servants in eating the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> which was by Gods preſcription to be eaten only <hi>by Aaron and his Sons,</hi> and who commanded the impotent man to <hi>take up his Bed and walk</hi> upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day; whence he ſeems evidently to infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">p. 173.</note>
               <q>That if God was pleaſed to ſuffer his own inſtitutions in matters ceremonial to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, when that neglect was needful to promote ſome higher end; if to preſerve the life of man and beaſt he would permit men to do that, which otherwiſe would have been deemed a breach of his own inſtitution, and a prophanation of his day, it is not to be doubted, but he will permit us to do thoſe things, which in their natures may be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, when it is neceſſary to ſubmit unto them, for the promotion of the great ends of love, peace, unity, and the advantage of poor Souls; if our reſpect unto our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life and health, will warrant our neglect of many outward duties, then ſurely our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the <hi>Churches</hi> peace and unity, and to the good of Souls, may warrant our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to thoſe things for theſe good ends, which God hath never plainly made it our duty to omit,</q> and our <hi>Superiours,</hi> whom he moſt plainly doth command us to obey in lawful matters do enjoin.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly,<note place="margin">p. 175.</note> That,
<q>if the duties mentioned, be of

               <note place="margin">Chap. 2. §. 1.</note> this he makes good from <hi>Scripture,</hi> from the concurring ſuffrage of all the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> from the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and dreadful conſequences of it; and from the oppoſition that it bears to the great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Charity, and Peace, of Union, and Edification. Now certainly it highly muſt concern us in reaſon and in Conſcience, where our miſtakes are like to prove of ſuch a fatal conſequence to our immortal ſouls, and to expoſe us to ſuch dreadful evils, to be very wary, before we venture upon that which is, by moſt judicious perſons in this <hi>Age,</hi> and was by all the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> pronounced <hi>Schiſmatical;</hi> as were all <hi>Altars</hi> ſet up in oppoſition to the <hi>Biſhop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe,</hi> wherein they were; all Churches ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from, and independent on his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

God therefore muſt have given to theſe Officers ſufficient power for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of theſe ends, as far as they are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the <hi>Church</hi> of God, but without a power of ſilencing diſputes when they ariſe, and do diſturb the <hi>Church,</hi> and making Rules for Uniformity, and Order, when differences do ariſe, and diviſions multiply, and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is introduced by variety of practice in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different matters, it is apparent they cannot obtain theſe ends in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> and
<pb n="xxij" facs="tcp:107117:12"/>therefore 'tis not to be doubted but God hath given them a power of making and impoſing of ſuch <hi>Rules</hi> in the forementioned caſes to thoſe ends.</p>

               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Conſider what is like to be the
<pb n="xxiij" facs="tcp:107117:12"/>natural reſult of your refuſal of Communion with us, even no leſs than <hi>Excommunication;</hi> which though perhaps the fault committed may not in it ſelf deſerve, yet can I ſee no reaſon, 1. Why you ſhould not dread the Sentence, ſeeing <hi>Paſtoris ſententia etiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſta timenda eſt,</hi> even the injuſt Sentence of <hi>Superiors</hi> may be dreaded when it doth actually deprive us of <hi>Church Priviledges;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſtand bound to do what lawfully we can, even all that is not evidently ſinful, to avoid it. 2. Nor can I ſee even why the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may not be valid before God, though not by reaſon of the moment of the things themſelves; yet for that diſobedience to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Governours,</hi> and violation of the Peace which is contained in our refuſal to ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
            <p>I confeſs there is an opinion much receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, that makes the <hi>cenſures</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> only <hi>declarative,</hi> which will excuſe you from theſe fears; for if the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe cenſures by God, be wholly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the merit of the cauſe for which they were inflicted, they can never be feared, nor conſequently prove coercive to their ſubjects, who are not convinced of the badneſs of their own cauſe, which in the event will never make them properly coercive at all: Beſides, thoſe cenſures which are ſuppoſed only <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative,</hi> not <hi>operative,</hi> are not properly the acts of <hi>authorized,</hi> but <hi>skilful</hi> perſons, for it is <hi>skill,</hi> not <hi>authority,</hi> that is a prudent preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that any thing is ſuch as it is declared; and therefore the opinions of learned, though but private perſons, would in this way of proceeding be more formidable than the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:107117:13"/>ſentences of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Governours,</hi> conſidered only under that relation. And laſtly, were the cenſures of the Church only declarative, offenders would be as much <hi>bound in Heaven,</hi> when not <hi>bound on Earth,</hi> as when they were ſo, ſince all Gods threats againſt them will be verified, though they be never cenſured by the Church; and ſo Chriſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>whatſoever you ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. will be wholly inſignificant.</p>

               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Conſider, I beſeech you, that no prejudices you have contracted, no ſcruples which do hinder your Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> can excuſe you from the guilt of Schiſm in ſeparating from her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you have done all that lawfully you may, and honeſtly you can, for the removal of thoſe <hi>prejudices,</hi> and for the ſatisfaction of thoſe <hi>ſcruples,</hi> it being all mens duty, as much as in them lies, to promote the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, and to prevent her Schiſms; and therefore to do all that lawfully and honeſtly they can, in the purſuit of thoſe good ends. Now, 1. you may impartially examine the grounds on which you do forſake Communion with us in all, or any of our publick Ordinances; you may diligently peruſe and read thoſe learned Tracts, which have been written to prove the lawfulneſs of your Communion with her in thoſe Ordinances; you may confer with the moſt able and judicious of her lawful <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and propound all your ſcruples to them in order to your ſatisfaction. And whoſoever ſeparates from Communion with us, without a conſcientious performance of theſe things, muſt certainly contract the guilt of Schiſm, or criminal ſeparation from us, becauſe he
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:107117:13"/>ſeparates before he hath done all that lawfully he may for the prevention of his ſeparation. And ſurely, <hi>my Dear Friends,</hi> it highly doth concern you, firſt to perform theſe duties, before you do proceed unto a fixed ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from our <hi>Church;</hi> for ſeeing what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in our <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> is the injunction of thoſe higher powers, to whom God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to be ſubject in all lawful matters, and that for Conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 5. and of thoſe ſpiritual Governours to whom the Goſpel doth command obedience and ſubmiſſion, as far as lawfully we may, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. unleſs we firſt examine thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of our <hi>Superiors Civil</hi> and <hi>Sacred,</hi> not daring to refuſe obedience to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find that they are contrary to the Law of God; we may oppoſe the will of God, whilſt we ſeem zealous for it, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the command of God, by tranſgreſſing the commands of our <hi>Superiours.</hi> And yet how few are thoſe <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with any able Paſtors of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> read any of their learned Tracts, or do impartially weigh the grounds on which they do proceed to ſeparation, it grieves me to conſider. God grant this be not laid unto their charge another day.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>15</label> Again, to take off all your ſcruples, which proceed upon your doubtings or ſuſpicions, that the <hi>Magiſtrates Civil</hi> or <hi>Sacred</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their bounds in the impoſing of theſe things, or do impoſe things doubtful;</p>
            <p>Conſider, I entreat you, 1. that this will never warrant your refuſal to obey <hi>Superiors,</hi> that you conceive the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> exceeds, or elſe unduly doth exert his power in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="xxvj" facs="tcp:107117:14"/>any thing, provided you may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obey it. Becauſe 'tis not your buſineſs or duty to enquire into the reaſon of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of your <hi>Superiors,</hi> to cenſure or paſs judgment of the expedience of them, or the inexpedience, but only to enquire whether you may lawfully obey what is commanded. For as the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould lay upon the ſubject no <hi>unneceſſary burthen;</hi> ſo neither ought the <hi>Maſter</hi> or the <hi>Parent,</hi> to lay ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens on his <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Servant;</hi> and yet none will excuſe a <hi>Child</hi> from his obedience to his <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Servant</hi> from obedience to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> upon this account, that they conceived the injunctions of their <hi>Maſter</hi> or their <hi>Parents</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient or unprofitable, provided they only did require that which might be lawfully performed: much leſs can Subjects be excuſed from their obedience to their <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Civil Parents</hi> upon theſe accounts. To ſuch injunctions we are obliged to ſubmit, though not on the account of any immediate power they have received from God to make them, the power they derive from him, being <hi>for edification only;</hi> yet on the ſame account that <hi>Chriſt</hi> paid tribute, <hi>leſt we ſhould offend them,</hi> and by our diſobedience in lawful matters, ſhould miniſter <hi>Scandal</hi> both to them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and cauſe them to ſuſpect that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion did countennnce diſobedience to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> in thoſe things, and tend to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us unquiet and unpeaceable; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thing enjoined may be a yoke, and an unneceſſary burthen, and ſo unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be laid upon us; yet our ſubmiſſion to it out of humility, and love to peace, and our reſpect to <hi>Gods Vicegerents,</hi> may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If nothing I have offered can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you to embrace Communion with us, let me intreat you to do all you can to teſtify that you abſtain from our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not out of humour, peeviſhneſs, or from a turbulent diſpoſition, and much leſs from a <hi>factious,</hi> and <hi>rebellious ſpirit,</hi> but purely out of <hi>Conſcience towards God.</hi> Do all that lawfully you can to ſhew that you are of a peaceable temper, deſirous of Communion with us, ſo far as Conſcience will permit you; that you do truly reverence your <hi>Governours,</hi> and are deſirous to yield obedience to them in all lawful things, and nothing which may give them juſt occaſion to ſuſpect that you do only <hi>Hypocritically</hi> pretend Conſcience for your diſobedience, or that you ſtill retain among you any <hi>Factious</hi> or <hi>Seditious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>

Therefore let me intreat you to comply with the eſtabliſhed worſhip of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as far as you declare, either by words or actions, that it is lawful ſo to do: for this you can do if you will, and therefore if you do not do it, you demonſtrate, againſt all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to the contrary, that you are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to comply with your <hi>Superiors</hi> as far as lawfully you may. As many of you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as do think it lawful to Communicate with us in Prayer, and hearing of the word, and in Receiving of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="xxviij" facs="tcp:107117:15"/>ſtand bound in Conſcience ſo to do, as oft as by the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> you are required ſo to do, and it can only be pretence of Conſcience which doth induce you to forbear ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us at theſe times; for ſeeing negative precepts do bind always, and at all times, ſo that no man at any time may do what is forbidden by God. It follows that there can be no prohibition againſt doing that at other times, which we can ſometimes do, and which cannot be more or leſs lawful or unlawful for being done at one time than another, as clearly ſeems to be the caſe with reference to your occaſional Communion. It therefore is to be ſuſpected that men only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Conſcience againſt that Communion with us at all times, which they at ſometimes can maintain. And yet I wiſh there were no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of men of your perſwaſions, who when they are preſented, or when they find it neceſſary to qualifie them for an Office, or to give a vote in which they may do ſervice to their party; will attend upon the publick worſhip uſed in our <hi>Churches;</hi> and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> according to the order of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who before never did, and afterwards neglect to do ſo. Now whilſt men do thus vary in their practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their intereſt, and as their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances vary, they tempt men ſhrewdly to ſuſpect that they act rather out of intereſt than Conſcience in theſe matters; and that they, notwithſtanding all their pretence to Conſcience, have either none at all, or a bad Conſcience; for if they thought Communion with us in thoſe Ordinances unlawful, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the forementioned circumſtances,
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:107117:15"/>they only muſt be <hi>doing evil that good may come,</hi> and making Conſcience, and Religion, ſtoop to intereſt; which is the proper character of <hi>Hypocrites:</hi> but if they did conceive it lawful, their Separation and refuſal of it cannot be excuſed from Schiſm, or from tranſgreſſion of the injunctions of St. <hi>Paul, If it be poſſible, as much as in you lies live peaceably with all men; follow after the things which make for peace; give no offence unto the Church of God; obey Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and ſubmit your ſelves.</hi> Ah my <hi>Dear Brethren!</hi> by doing of theſe things you have given greater ſcandal unto others, than your ſubmiſſion to the Conſtitutions of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> could have done; and therefore if you do indeed abſtain from our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for fear of giving <hi>ſcandal to weak Brethren,</hi> do you more carefully abſtain from matters of this nature which carry with them ſuch a plain ſemblance of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> that no pretence can hide, no Charity excuſe it.</p>
            <p>Under this head I cannot paſs by your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence in <hi>Petitioning His Sacred Majeſty</hi> againſt His <hi>Royal Proclamation</hi> to the contrary; for be it granted that the Law did authorize, or give permiſſion to you to <hi>Petition,</hi> ſure I am it laid upon you no neceſſity to do ſo; and ſo this might have been forborn in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the pleaſure of his <hi>Majeſty:</hi> And if you do Reply, That then you may by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations be abridged of that liberty the Law affords you.

To prove that lawfully they may, I might Inſiſt on many Topicks: As 1. That which doth throw the Burthen of proving the unlawfulneſs of holding Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with us in the forementioned Worſhip, upon them, and of this Nature, is the following Argument, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is lawful to hold Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> in all her <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>ſolemn</hi> parts of <hi>Publick Worſhip,</hi> which in thoſe parts of Publick Worſhip requires nothing which is unlawful to be done by thoſe who ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with her in them; but the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in all her conſtant and ſolemn parts of Publick Worſhip, requires nothing to be done which is unlawful to be done by thoſe who ſhall communicate with her in them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis lawful to communicate with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107117:21"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in all her conſtant and ſolemn parts of Publick Worſhip.</q> Where by the conſtant and ſolemn parts of Publick Worſhip, I underſtand thoſe parts of Publick Worſhip which ſhe requires all <hi>Laymen</hi> to joyn with her in, under the penalty of being lyable to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and to be ſubject to her cenſures, if they do refuſe them, that in theſe parts of <hi>Solemn Worſhip</hi> nothing unlawful is required of them, I ſhall endeavour to make good by Anſwering the Objections which they make againſt them. But I might do it more briefly by calling on them to inſtance in any thing unlawful to be done, which is required in any conſtant and ſolemn part of Publick Worſhip, upon which they are by the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> obliged to attend under the penalty of being ſubject to her Cenſures for their Neglect, or their Refuſal ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, I might thus argue with them: <hi>That which the Church of Chriſt hath in all Ages, ſince the Apoſtles, required of her ſubjects, cannot be reaſonably conceived unlawful to be done, for otherwiſe we muſt condemn the univerſal Church of Chriſt through all Ages, ſince the time of the Apoſtles, but the Church of Chriſt throughout all Ages hath required of her Subjects conditions of Communion like unto thoſe required by the Church of England, And therefore theſe conditions of Communion cannot be reaſonably deemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be done.</hi> In Confirmation of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it would be very eaſy to inſtance in multitudes of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> required of, and uſed by the members of the Univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> throughout all Ages conſequent to that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as lyable to the exceptions of <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> as are any Ceremonies impoſed by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107117:22"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo to evince that <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> were always uſed by the <hi>Church</hi> from the 3d. Century at leaſt, unto this preſent Age. And thence to ſhew that our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do by condemning theſe things in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in effect condemn the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> throughout all Ages, and all Places; <note place="margin">Def. of the principles of love. p. 55.</note> for as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> well obſerves, <hi>they who condemn our Church for reaſons common to all the Ages of the Church, must virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the fore-going Ages of the Churches.</hi> But becauſe <hi>Laymen</hi> are ignorant of what was practiſed by <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and have been taught that <hi>Anti-christ began to work in the Apoſtles days,</hi> and therefore have but little Reverence for Arguments of this Nature, I ſhall endeavour to convince them of the lawfulneſs of holding Communion with us in theſe Ordinances, by the Example of our Bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> who in like caſes did yield Obedience and Submit to the Preſcriptions of the Rulers of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> And 2ly, I ſhall endeavour to return a full and a perſpicuous Anſwer to all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments they urge from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or from Reaſon, to prove that 'tis unlawful to ſubmit unto the things required by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in order to Communion with her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning firſt with thoſe Arguments which do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the things required by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the Conditions of <hi>Lay Communion,</hi> to be ſinful in themſelves, or things forbidden by the Word of God. And 2ly, Proceeding to the Conſideration of thoſe Arguments which do allow the things impoſed to be lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but yet ſuppoſe it is unlawful for them to ſubmit unto them. 1. Becauſe the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them is a Violation of their <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107117:22"/>Liberty.</hi> 2ly, Becauſe by their Submiſſion to them as they imagine, they ſhall be indirectly guilty of the ſin of the <hi>Impoſers.</hi> 3ly, Becauſe they have been abuſed to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and therefore are become unlawful to be uſed. And 4ly, Becauſe by uſing of them they may ſcandalize the Weak, which God having forbidden, no Precept of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> can oblige them to do.</p>

And 3ly, from the fourth verſe we may learn that even when their <hi>heavy Burthens, and Grievous to be born,</hi> were bound upon infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, they were obliged, if they were not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to ſubmit unto them, for they being in the number of the things commanded by them what could exempt inferiors from doing and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them according to our <hi>Lords</hi> Command, if
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107117:30"/>they were lawful to be done. Wherefore, in caſes of like Nature, all <hi>Chriſtian people</hi> ought to obſerve and do what is commanded and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Superiors,</hi> to whom the Office of Teaching and Interpreting the Laws of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is legally committed, tho their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands prove ſometimes heavy Burthens, and Grievous to be born, provided that they be not ſinful, that is, forbidden by that Law which they are Authoriſed to expound and teach.

            <p>Hence it will alſo follow, <hi>that great Corruptions in the Lives of our Church-Paſtors will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant our ſeparation from Communion with them, or our Refuſal to attend upon their Teaching, provided we be not enjoyned to allow of, or to comply with them in their ſins.</hi> Our Saviour ſent the <hi>Leper</hi> to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to offer by his Hands the accuſtomed Sacrifices, altho the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> then was much degenerated both in its Office, and in the manners of thoſe who mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred at the Altar, we find that Chriſt himſelf was preſent at their ſolemn Feaſts, and therefore did not come empty, which the Law forbad, but brought his Sacrifice, and by ſo doing owned their <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> he was a Member of a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and ſo he joyned in the Service of their <hi>Synagogues</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and upon other Solemn Days, and yet their own <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that the whole <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> were then a very wicked people; they were, ſaith truth it ſelf, <hi>an Evil, Wicked, and Adulterous Generation.</hi> The <hi>Teachers,</hi> and the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> whom Chriſt commands the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to obey in all things

            <p>Hence 3ly, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 3. §. 13.</note> we infer <hi>that it is lawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ſuch Churches as enjoyn ſome ſignificant Ceremonies not mentioned in the Word of God, &amp; for the ſake of Peace, Order, Unity, and the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scandal, to ſubmit unto them, when by Authority they are impoſed,</hi> for this we find our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, he ate the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover</hi> prepared according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo he did partake of that thick Sawce, which ſignifyed the thick Clay which they in <hi>Aegypt</hi> formed into <hi>Brick,</hi> he ate the Paſſover in ſuch a Poſture as was uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſignify their Reſt, and their Security in the Good Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> He, when he went

He, when he read the Law, ſtood up, as was enjoyned by the <hi>Jews</hi> in honour of the Law, and when he taught the people, he conſtantly ſate down ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom which had then obtained. The Impoſition of hands in their ordinary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction was a ſignificant Ceremony, <note place="margin">

            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:107117:33"/>
            <p>Hence alſo we conclude <hi>that we ſtand not obliged in all Punctilios of Time, <note place="margin">

Even ſo, altho <hi>Chriſt</hi> celebrated the Sacrament after Supper, and albeit he did it in a poſture of Recumbency, we do not ſtand obliged to conform unto theſe Circumſtances, they being done upon ſuch grounds as do not now remain, for we have now no <hi>Paſchal</hi> Supper to be eaten before the Sacrament, nor is it the Cuſtom of our <hi>Nations</hi> to lye down on Couches when we eat, nor have we any cauſe to do it in token of our Reſt in <hi>Canaan.</hi> And if we are obliged to uſe that very Geſture which our <hi>Saviour</hi> did, why are we not as much obliged to the ſame time; I mean not only after Supper, but annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the ſame Night in which our Saviour was betrayed, why are we not as much obliged to receive in the ſame place, <hi>viz.</hi> an Inn, or in an Upper-chamber. And laſtly tho it be unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable that in the Primitive Inſtitution <hi>Wine was mixt with Water,</hi> for ſo the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> teſtify, and ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Cuſtom and their <hi>Canons</hi> teach, and albeit this ſeems more fit to repreſent that Water and that Blood which iſſued from our <hi>Saviours</hi> Side, yet, becauſe now it ceaſeth to be the Cuſtom to drink Wine mixt with Water, <note place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107117:33"/>and from our <hi>Saviours</hi> Aphoriſm, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> I think we ſhould not ſcruple to baptiſe by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> altho our Lords <hi>Diſciples</hi> did baptize by dipping, and that more perfectly! doth repreſent that Death of <hi>Christ</hi> into which, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we are baptized, and the enſuing Reſurrection. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 6. §. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hence do we argue, <hi>That the Preſence of wicked and ungodly Men ſhould not deter us from joyning with the Church in the Participation of the Holy Sacrament,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſcruple, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Paſſovers</hi> as he participated of, to eat with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> him he admitted to the Holy Sacrament, as being by Profeſſion one of his true <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and one who had done nothing openly which contradicted that Profeſſion, altho <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew that he was a covetous Wretch, into whom <hi>Satan</hi> had already entred, and who would certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo we infer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 7. §. 17.</note> 
               <hi>That we ſtand not obliged to refuſe Communion with other Churches in their Sacraments, and other publick Offices, becauſe of ſome additions to the Inſtitution which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the ſake of Order, Uniformity, or Decency, but are declared to be no parts, or neceſſary appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to the Inſtitution.</hi> You ſee how many things the <hi>Jews</hi> had added to the Paſſover, <hi>the Wine,</hi> becauſe it was a Feaſt of Joy, <hi>the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Cup</hi> before they drank it, <hi>the Breaking the unleavened Cake, the Hymn,</hi> and yet our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> did not ſcruple to obſerve theſe things; And you may ſee in Dr. <hi>Leightfoots</hi> Service of the <hi>Temple,</hi> how many Ceremonies they had added to the obſervance of the other <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> at which our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> were ſtill preſent. And therefore on the ſame account we need not ſcruple that antient Ceremony of <hi>Croſſing</hi> which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107117:34"/>we uſe in Baptiſm, ſeeing our <hi>Church</hi> declares that ſhe doth not intend it as any part of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, or any neceſſary appendant of it, (on which account ſhe doth command us to omit it in our private <hi>Baptiſms</hi>) but only as a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Ceremony to teſtify unto the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the baptized Perſon hath Relation to the Society of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſtands obliged to maintain the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith. As therefore, when the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> had built themſelves an <hi>Altar,</hi> their Brethren were troubled at it, but when they underſtood it was not built for Sacrifice, or in Rebellion, but to entitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterity to a Share in Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick and ſolemn Worſhip; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.16, 30, 31.</note> And to an Intereſt in his Tabernacle, and <hi>Altar,</hi> they were well pleaſed, and declared their hearty Satisfaction; ſo would our Brethren conſider that the Croſs in Baptiſm is enjoyned not as a part, or neceſſary appendant of that Ordinance, but only to be <hi>Ed,</hi> a Teſtimony to the Congregation that the baptized Perſon had an Intereſt in the Society of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and was obliged to maintain, and own the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, they would have equal reaſon to be well pleaſed, and to declare their Satisfaction in the Matter.</p>
            <p>Hence it is evident <hi>that our Diſſenters have no juſt cauſe to fear, <note place="margin">

That this is the true intent of this Precept is plain by the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107117:43"/>ground of this prohibition delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>Take ye therefore good heed to your ſelves for you ſaw no manner of ſimilitude on the day that the Lord ſpake to you in</hi> Horeb: <hi>Leſt you corrupt, and make you a graven Image, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42.8.</note> my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Praiſe to graven Images.</hi> For who can, without bluſhing, ſay that God is robbed of the outward Worſhip due unto him by our kneeling at the Sacrament, our uſing the ſurplice, or making the ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> upon a Childs Forehead; whereas he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tells us that he is robbed of his Praiſe and Glory, by giving of Religious Worſhip unto <hi>graven Images,</hi> it being only due unto that God to whom every Knee ſhall bow. But, ſaith Dr. <hi>Ames, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 302.</note> The very Phantaſies or Images of the mind not preſcribed by God are by moſt Interpreters held as well forbidden as outward Real Images.</hi> Anſw. if ſo, the moſt are not always the beſt <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,</hi> there being nothing more abſurd and fooliſh than this Interpretation, never thought of by any of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> or approved of by any but <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> 2ly, If this be true I know not any thing more forbidden by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment than this Book of Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> ſo full of Phantaſies of his own deviſing, that nothing can be more, all which undoubtedly were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him for ſome religious uſe. Nay this very Interpretation is forbidden here, it being
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107117:44"/>certainly a Phantaſy of the Mind without all ground from the Commandment. Nay all our pious Books, our conceived Prayers, our Method in compoſing Sermons, and an hundred things of like Nature will be here prohibited. The Argument whereby the Dr. <hi>Labors</hi> to confirm this fond intepretation is, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 297.</note> that <hi>the Word likeneſs uſed in the ſecond Commandment is General, and comprehendeth under it all religious ſimilitudes, becauſe they are Homogeneal to Images, they are expreſly forbidden.</hi> Anſw. The Foundation of this Argument is a plain falſhood, for the Word Likeneſs is not General, but by the Text is plainly, limited to <hi>Images,</hi> or <hi>Likeneſſes of Male or Female. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut</hi> 4.16, 17, 18.</note> The Likeneſs of any Beaſt that is on the Earth; The Likeneſs of any winged Fowl that flyeth in the Air; The Likeneſs of any thing that creepeth on the Ground; The Likeneſs of any Fiſh that is in the Waters.</hi> The Likeneſs which may be ſeen is that which is forbidden, <hi>v.</hi> 15. 'Tis the Likeneſs of any thing <hi>in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Waters under the Earth,</hi> Exod. 20.4. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> goes on to Argue from the Affirmative part of the ſecond Commandment thus: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 299.</note> 
               <hi>This Commandment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns Obedience to all the Worſhip appointed by God, all which was ſignificative, for it ſerved to the Example and Shadow of Heavenly things,</hi> Heb. 8.5. Heb. 10.1. <hi>The Law having a Shadow of things to come: Therefore it forbiddeth any ſignificative Ceremonies to be brought into the Worſhip of God deviſed by man.</hi> Anſw. to omit the Illogicalneſs of this Argument, and the many terms in the concluſion which are not vertually contained in the premiſſes, which every freſh Man may perceive, I Anſw. 1. That it is falſly, or at leaſt precariouſly affirmed that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107117:44"/>enjoyns Obedience to all the Worſhip appointed by God. It is the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which commands us to have God for our God, that is, to give him all the Internal Acts of Devotion, and the External Acts of Piety which are proper to God, and are in Scripture ſignified by loving God with all our Hearts, by fearing, worſhipping, and ſerving him. The ſecond Commandment doth limit the manner of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing and expreſſing our Devotion to the true Object of it, interdicting that mode which in the Practice of <hi>Antient</hi> times had ſo generally prevailed of repreſenting the <hi>Deities,</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be ſuch, in ſome corporeal ſhape, &amp; thereto yielding ſuch expreſſions of reſpect as they conceived ſuitable, and acceptable to ſuch <hi>Deities.</hi> The Affirmative part of this Precept ſeems therefore to be chiefly this:
<q>Thou ſhalt give outward Religious Worſhip by bowing, humbling of thy Body,</q> or falling down to me. ſo that our kneeling at the Sacrament, or bowing to the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> when we hear his Sacred Name, which minds us of the great Bleſſings which he hath procured for us, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due unto him for them, our bowing of the body to him when we go into the place of Worſhip, is only doing what in the General is here commanded, which if Diſſenters well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they would ſee the vanity of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt thoſe laudable Practices of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Farther the poſitive part of this Precept may imply that in our Devotions and Religious Services of God we ſhould raiſe our mind above groſs Senſe and Phancy, that we ſhould entertain high and worthy conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of God, that we ſhould apprehend him incomparably Superiour to all things which we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107117:45"/>ſee and know; in a word, that we ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spirit and in Truth; not as the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> in the <hi>Image of a Dove,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſaid to worſhip they knew not what, nor as the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of good things to come, and ſuch like Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. In theſe two things ſeem fully to be compriſed the ſpecial poſitive Duty of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Anſw. 2. When Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> adds, <hi>that all the worſhip appointed by God is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and that it was all ſignificative,</hi> and proveth this from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.1. Which manifeſtly ſpeak only of <hi>Shadows</hi> of things to come, it clearly follows from his Argument that all Worſhip of God is now aboliſhed, and become unlawful, for all the Worſhip ſpoken of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.1. is clearly aboliſhed, and rendred unlawful to us by the appearance of the ſubſtance of which they were <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows.</hi> 3ly, 'Tis certain that we owe Obedience to all the parts of Worſhip appointed by God, ſignificative, or not ſignificative, but how doth it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that ſignificative Ceremonies which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be no parts of Gods Worſhip, but only accidental Circumſtances, may not be required by men any more than it will follow that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath commanded Obedience to all the <hi>Honour</hi> due to my Natural, <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Parents, and hath commanded all the Love I owe unto my Brother, that therefore I may uſe no expreſſion of honour to my <hi>Parents,</hi> or love unto my <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Brother which he hath not commanded? Thus have I anſwered all that is conſiderable in Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> on this Head, and all that the Diſſenters urge from the Old Teſtament againſt Submiſſion to the Ceremonies appointed to be uſed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

Now the Commandments of men are all thoſe things which the <hi>Authority</hi> of man enjoyneth, or forbids us to believe or do, tho God hath not enjoyned or ſorbid them, and theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are taught for Doctrines, when they are impoſed on the Judgment of men in point of Faith as things to be believed, or owned as por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Will of God, or on the Conſciences of men, as things to be obſerved as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, or ſuch religious actions as from their Nature are required to pleaſe him.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107117:56"/>
               <hi>New Teſtament</hi> concerning all thoſe Matters.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> 2ly, According to this Argument the <hi>Scripture</hi> muſt have preſcribed both <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> and all the things which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Anſwer to the laſt Objection, or elſe no Time or Place, or any of thoſe things which are left undetermined by it, can be requiſite or convenient to be uſed in the Worſhip of God. So monſtrouſly abſurd is this way of Arguing. In farther Confutation of this Argument, I ſhall firſt lay down plainly the Aſſertion or Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in reference to the Perfection of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and from it give a direct Anſwer to this Objection. 2ly, I ſhall lay down the contrary <hi>Tenet</hi> of ſome <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> which is here aſſerted in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. 3ly, I ſhall endeavor to ſhew the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſneſs of this Opinion, and the Swarms of evil conſequences which do naturally follow from it. And 4ly, That they who hold it did, &amp; do many things repugnant to it. And 5ly, That it doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily make the Holy Scripture an imperfect Rule.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, when we aſſert that <hi>Scripture is a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107117:56"/>perfect Rule,</hi> we mean it thus, that <hi>it doth perfectly contain all that is neceſſary to be believed, or done, in Order to our acceptance with God here, or to our happineſs with him hereafter,</hi> not that it doth particularly preſcribe what ever Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Order, Decency</hi> or <hi>Convenience</hi> may be obſerved in the Service of God. And this doth ſeem to me to be the true Diſtinction in this matter betwixt the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Rigid Puritan,</hi> that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> aſſerts the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> to be <hi>a full and perfect Rule of all the Articles of Chriſtian Faith, and Chriſtian Piety,</hi> but notwithſtanding he maintains that <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> hath left it in the Power of the <hi>Church Governors Sacred,</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> to appoint ſuch <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to be uſed in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, as they ſhall judge convenient, and conducing to the ends of Unity, and Order, Peace, and Love, Decency, Uniformity, and the Edification of the <hi>Church.</hi> And that by virtue of theſe General Rules, <hi>Follow after the things, <note place="margin">

So that we do aſſert in Anſwer unto this Objection,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Scripture is a perfect Rule of all Ceremonies that <hi>are good Works antecedently to the Command of man,</hi> ſo that in Scripture ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for them may be found, but that it is not ſuch a Rule of indifferent Ceremonies. 2ly, That 'tis as perfect a Rule as it needs to be in reference to <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uncommanded in particular; (1) By giving us the general Rules which ſhould direct <hi>Superiours</hi> in the impoſing of theſe things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but not in a particular Preſcription of them, as this <hi>Objection</hi> doth ſuppoſe, it being a plain contradiction that any thing ſhould be to us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and yet preſcribed to us in the Word of God. <hi>Diſſenters</hi> therefore muſt deny that there is any circumſtance of Worſhip, be it Time, Place, Geſture, or the Words in which it is to be performed, left indifferent, or that being ſo, that circumſtance muſt not be uſed in Gods Worſhip, or elſe they muſt confeſs the weakneſs of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument produced. And 2ly, Becauſe it doth command us to obey <hi>Superiors</hi> Civil, and Sacred, in all lawful matters, and ſo inſtructs us to ſubmit to what is not forbidden by Gods Word, when by <hi>Superiors</hi> it is commanded. This is our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107117:57"/>Tenet, and this is a direct, and a ſufficient anſwer to this Argument:</p>
            <p>But on the other hand the Tenet of ſome <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> owned by this Argument, is this: <hi>That no Church Governors ought to ordain, or introduce into the Service of God any other Rites or Obſervations than ſuch as God hath in his Word commanded, or Chriſt and his Apoſtles by their Examples, which they eſteem as Precepts hath approved, and that if they enjoyn ſuch things we muſt not yield obedience to them, but muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them as humane inventions, ſuperſtition, and will worſhip.</hi> This is that Doctrine in which the Myſtery of <hi>Puritaniſm</hi> doth conſiſt, and the pernicious conſequences of it are ſo many that any perſon, who doth weigh them ſeriouſly, will, if he be indeed a Lover of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> abhor, and heartily renounce that Doctrine whence they ſo naturally flow. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Doctrine caſts a reproach upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it gives juſt cauſe to <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to ſcruple the admiſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and to the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and the <hi>Polititian</hi> to repreſent it as the great inſtrument of ſedition, and diſobedience. For this opinion obliges men to thwart the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> in all indifferent matters which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with a reſpect unto Gods Worſhip: If he commands them to come to <hi>Church</hi> on the <hi>Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place, they muſt ſtand bound in conſcience by this Rule to refuſe to do ſo, becauſe in Scripture God hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <hi>how oft, what hour,</hi> or <hi>where</hi> they ſhould aſſemble, if he commands them to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi> in the Houſe of God, to <hi>ſtand,</hi> or <hi>kneel</hi> whilſt they are praying, to <hi>ſit</hi> whilſt hearing, or the like, they muſt not do it, becauſe God hath not told them in his Word that they ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107117:58"/>in his preſence, that they ſhould kneel, or ſtand whilſt they do pray, or ſit when they do hear.

            <p n="2">2ly, Upon the ſame account it muſt be ſinful to obey thoſe <hi>Civil</hi> Laws which do concern thoſe Laws of <hi>Juſtice, Charity,</hi> and Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Brother which cannot clearly be collected from the written Word. For it is plain from Scripture that theſe are the <hi>more weighty matters of the Law,</hi>

Since therefore God is more concerned for matters of this Nature, than for his outward worſhip, his Word muſt be more perfect in preſcribing of theſe duties, than any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his worſhip, if then it be unlawful for us to ſubmit to any Ceremonies commanded by man which reſpect his worſhip, becauſe <hi>Gods Word muſt be a perfect Rule, not only of all parts, but of all modes of Worſhip;</hi> it muſt be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to ſubmit to any humane conſtitutions touching Equity, and Juſtice, Mercy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, Love, Charity, and Peace; becauſe Gods Word muſt be ſuppoſed, in theſe more weighty and ſubſtantial matters, to be a Rule more perfect; And therefore all the Laws and Statutes reſpecting matters of this Nature, which cannot be collected from the Words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> muſt, by this doctrine, be caſhiered as vain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt ſtand obliged to refuſe obedience to them. For inſtance, I am commanded to worſhip God in publick, but whether I muſt do it in a <hi>Church,</hi> or in the <hi>Field,</hi> in <hi>black,</hi> or <hi>white,</hi> or any other garb, by <hi>ſtinted Words,</hi> or by Expreſſions of my own <hi>immediate Invention,</hi> in this, or that, or a 3d poſture, is not expreſſed in <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> If therefore in theſe caſes I muſt not yield obedience to any power that will command me to worſhip God in white, to pray in <hi>ſtinted Words,</hi> to do it <hi>kneeling,</hi> or the like, becauſe that <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is a Rule of Worſhip, hath not determined of theſe things, muſt I not do the like in other caſes of an higher Nature? and becauſe <hi>Scripture</hi> hath commanded that I ſhould be charitable, and give Alms, but hath not ſaid <hi>what portion</hi> I ſhall give, nor <hi>when,</hi>

For theſe are obſervations which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not from Scripture, but from the title of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the Patronage of Cuſtom.</hi> This was the Practice of the firſt Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> and as it grew more <hi>ancient</hi> its Conſtitutions grew more numerous, and ſo the men of this opinion, had they lived then, (as they did not, none that we read of in thoſe times ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſeparation from any <hi>Church</hi> on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts) they muſt have been obliged to ſeparate from all the <hi>Churches</hi> then in being. Come we to all the <hi>Churches</hi> of this preſent Age, and we ſhall find that this opinion will oblige the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of it to ſeparate from them alſo. For the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the <hi>Eaſtern Churches</hi> they muſt much more abominate on this account than any others, becauſe their Ceremonies are more numerous, and many of them <hi>ſuperſtitious.</hi> The <hi>Lutheran Churches</hi> have not only <hi>Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> and other ancient Ceremonies, which we obſerve, but they have alſo <hi>Images,</hi> &amp; many other obſervations, which theſe men ſtile <hi>Superſtitious, Popiſh, Antichriſtian Ceremonies.</hi> In the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Churches</hi> they will find <hi>Lyturgies</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention, and change of Apparel for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, even at <hi>Geneva</hi> they will find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned a <hi>Book of Common Prayer</hi> compoſed by <hi>Calvin,</hi> the <hi>Wafer Cake, the uſe of God-Fathers in Baptiſm, bidding of Prayer,</hi> with divers other <hi>Coremonies,</hi> no where commanded in the Holy Scripture; and ſo as Dr. <hi>Durel</hi> largely proves, it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107117:60"/>is in all <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> of the <hi>Weſt. I am not able,</hi> ſaith Mr. Baxter, <hi>to bear the thoughts of ſeparating from almoſt all Chriſts Churches upon Earth, but he that ſeparateth from one, or many, <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>This Tenet gives a great advantage to <hi>Popery,</hi> for it aſſerts that nothing circumſtantial muſt be performed in Gods worſhip without particular direction from the Word. Now it is certain that many circumſtances of worſhip, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Prayer, Preaching of the Word, Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, Church Government, the Exerciſe of Church diſcipline,</hi> are not determined in the written Word of God, and therefore it is needful, if this principle be true, either to own Traditions touching matters of this Nature to be received as the Word of God, or to confeſs he hath appointed ſome <hi>infallible perſons,</hi> whether <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi> it is not much material, whoſe determinations in theſe matters muſt be received as the Word of God. Now theſe two Tenets are the fundamental parts of <hi>Popery,</hi> on which their other Doctrins, and Practices depend, and which, if we admit, we cannot rationally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whatſoever theſe infallible <hi>Judges</hi> ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, or deliver as <hi>the unwritten Word of God.</hi> I ſhall conclude this head with a large Paſſage out of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who, in his defence of his principles of Love, ſpeaks thus.
<q>There
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107117:61"/>are men, otherwiſe very honeſt and truly Godly, who think that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is intended by God not only as a general Rule, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Law for all the very circumſtances of worſhip, and that the ſecond Commandment in particular condemneth all that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or invention of man in or about the Worſhip of God, and that to deny this is to deny the perfection of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> If this opinion prevail, ſaith he, what abundance of hurt will it do?</q> For</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. It draweth men into the dangerous guilt of adding to the Word of God, under pretence of defending its perfection, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. For what is adding to the Word of God, but making that to be commanded or forbidden by that Word, which is not there commanded or forbidden? Since therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is that all particular circumſtances of worſhip are not by that Word preſcribed, as I have proved already, (whence it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow that ſome neceſſary circumſtances not there preſcribed cannot be forbidden) it is plain that this opinion which ſaith that all circumſtances of worſhip are particularly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Scripture, and that all not preſcribed are forbidden there, muſt add unto the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, It prepareth men for <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and the denyal of the Authority of <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> for when men are made to believe that Scripture, if it be a perfect Rule, muſt be a Rule for thoſe things which are not found in it at all, they muſt be tempted, when they cannot find all Accidents of worſhip particularly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in it, to ſuſpect it as a deluſory, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thing. The <hi>Divine</hi> Will ſay, it tells me
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107117:61"/>not ſufficiently, and particularly what Books of Scripture are <hi>Canonical,</hi> nor which of the various Readings are right, nor whether it be to be divided into Chapters, and Verſes, nor into how many, nor in what Metre and Tune I muſt ſing Pſalms, nor what perſons ſhall be <hi>Paſtors</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> nor what Text I ſhall chuſe next, nor what Words or Method I ſhall uſe in my next Prayer or Sermon.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, This opinion which ſeems to plead for the perfection of the Scripture Rule, doth plainly charge it with imperfection, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, for it aſſerts that it is neceſſary in Order to the perfection of this Rule that it ſhould have preſcribed every particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance and mode of worſhip fit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be uſed in Gods Service, and it is farther requiſite that it ſhould do this clearly in all the inſtances forementioned, ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we cannot be aſſured, that we act in all theſe modes and circumſtances according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its directions. Now ſeeing it is certain that it hath not done ſo in all the inſtances fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned in anſwer to the former Arguments, ſince learned, pious and judicious men can find no ſuch determinations there, and therefore judge, diſpute, and act ſo variouſly in thoſe matters, becauſe they find nothing delivered in thoſe caſes with ſo great clearneſs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity as may determine them in all theſe caſes how to act; I ſay this being ſo, it muſt be evident that <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot be according to this ſuppoſition a ſufficient, plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly, This miſtake tends to caſt all rational worſhip out of the <hi>Church</hi> by deterring men from inventing, or ſtudying how to do Gods
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107117:62"/>Work aright, for if all that man inventeth or deviſeth, without a particular direction from the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> be forbidden by it, then muſt we not ſtudy to find out the true Method of Praying or Preaching, nor muſt we ſtudy what to ſay till we are ſpeaking, nor what time, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, place or words to uſe, there being no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction for theſe things, it being only ſaid in general, <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that needs not be aſhamed.</hi> Now baniſh Study, and you baniſh Knowledge, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion from the World.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly, This opinion will bring in all confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inſtead of pure reaſonable worſhip, whilſt every man is left to find that in <hi>Scripture</hi> which never was there, one will think that he findeth one thing there, and another, another thing. Yea every man will be apt to think he findeth that there which his own corrupt mind brings thither. It will bring confuſion into <hi>Families,</hi> as well as <hi>Churches,</hi> whilſt every Child, and Servant will, by this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, be tempted to reject the Inſtructions of his <hi>Maſter,</hi> or <hi>Father</hi> who would teach him a Catechiſin, or form of Prayer for which the Scripture affords him no particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly, And hereby all poſſibility of Union among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt periſh, till this opinion periſh; for if we muſt unite only in that which <hi>Scripture</hi> doth particularly direct us to, we muſt not unite at all. If we muſt all in ſinging Pſalms agree in no Metre, or tune in the <hi>Church,</hi> but one that <hi>Scripture</hi> hath preſcribed us, we muſt not ſing at all; If we muſt pray in publick only in Words preſcribed by <hi>Scripture</hi> to be uſed in publick, we muſt not pray at all in publick;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107117:62"/>If we muſt receive the Sacrament only when it is conſecrated in Words preſcribed by <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> we muſt not receive at all.</p>
               <p n="7">7ly, Hereby <hi>Chriſtian</hi> love will be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, when every man muſt account his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Tranſgreſſor</hi> againſt the perfect Rule of <hi>Scripture</hi> that cannot ſhew a Text of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> for the hour, the place of worſhip, the bells, the hour-glaſſes, the pulpit, the utenſils which are uſed in the Service of God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thoſe pious Men, <hi>Calvin, Cartwright, Sibs, Perkins, Hilderſham,</hi> who uſed a form of Prayer, yea almoſt all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the World muſt be condemned.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly, This Doctrine will rack and perplex the Conſcience of all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by forcing them to think that they are guilty of ſin by every Tune, Metre, Word, Geſture, Time, Place, or any other Circumſtance of worſhip which they uſe without a Scripture warrant. On this account ſome dare not pray in their Families, ſome dare not think what they ſhall pray, ſome dare not teach their Children to pray, ſome dare not hear a ſtudyed Sermon, or read a printed Book. To conclude, this Tenet will affright poor people from <hi>Scripture</hi> and Religion, and make us, our doctrine and worſhip ridiculous in the ſight of all the World.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I add that they who do aſſert this Tenet, do many things repugnant to it. As <hi>v. g.</hi> They introduce <hi>Lay Elders</hi> unordained, of whom there is no mention in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or in the <hi>Church</hi> of the firſt Ages. They ſing in ſtinted Metre Hymns of their own deviſing, for which no Precept or Example can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107117:63"/>from the Book of God. Beſides where hath our <hi>Lord,</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> enjoyned a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory for publick worſhip? and that which they impoſed, what <hi>Authority</hi> could it pretend to, but that of man? They when they take an Oath do not refuſe to lay their hands upon, and kiſs the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Now all agree that <hi>Oaths are ſolemn Acts of Divine Worſhip,</hi> for they are Invocations of God, and thereby we acknowledge his Omniſcience, and that he knows the uprightneſs of our intentions, and that his Juſtice will avenge it ſelf on the falſe Swearer, and that his Power is able to inflict upon him the ſevereſt Judgments, and that he by his promiſe ſtands bound to help, and to reward all thoſe who do believe, and act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Here therefore is an outward <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Humane Inſtitution</hi> joyned with many acts of religious worſhip. Again when they enjoyned the <hi>ſolemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> they ordered that the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould take it 1. <hi>uncovered,</hi> 2 <hi>ſtanding,</hi> 3. <hi>with their right hand lift up and bare.</hi> Now let any man of reaſon ſay, if it be unlawful to ſubmit to our three Ceremonies of kneeling, croſſing, and wearing a white Garment in Gods Service, why it is leſs unlawful to uſe three other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in that more ſolemn act of worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking of an Oath, or if men may appoint theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to be uſed in taking of an Oath, what hinders but in other acts of worſhip they may do the like?</p>

               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>It is unlawful to add unto the parts of Gods worſhip, but to add our Ceremonies to Gods worſhip is to add to the parts of Gods worſhip, which they endeavour to prove by</hi> 12 <hi>Arguments. To this Argument we anſwer</hi> 1. <hi>By ſhewing what outward worſhip in the general is,</hi> viz. <hi>The Acknowledgment of ſome Excellency in the Perſon worſhipped, by actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to expreſs our Senſe or Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Excellency.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107117:64"/>derogate from his Prophetick Office, which is the only Teacher of his Church, and the Appointer of all means whereby we ſhould be taught.</hi> Anſw. 1. <hi>That it falſly is ſuppoſed that the Rulers of our Church have ordained any Ceremonies to teach Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Duties by their Myſtical Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or to be Authentick means of Spiritual Teaching.</hi> (2) <hi>That it can be no derogation from Chriſts Prophetick, or his Kingly Office to ſtir up our minds by things apt to ſtir them up to the performance of their duty, or to expreſs and ſignify our duty by things apt to expreſs and ſignify it.</hi> 3ly, <hi>That it is not true that Chriſt in Scripture hath ſet down all things by which we may be admoniſhed of our duty.</hi> 4. <hi>That this Argument concludes with equal ſtrength againſt the impoſition of all Ceremonies, even time and place.</hi> 5ly, <hi>That the Injunction made by Rulers for Decency and Order, if they do truly anſwer theſe ends, are made by virtual Commiſſion from Chriſt, and therefore can be no Entrenchment on his Legiſlative Power.

            <p>Now outward worſhip in the general is <hi>the Acknowledgment of ſome Excellency in the Perſon worſhipped by actions proper to expreſs our Senſe or Apprehenſion of that Excellency,</hi> ſo that three things concur unto the Conſtitution of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:107117:66"/>1. An apprehenſion of that <hi>excellency</hi> in a perſon which deſerves to be adored.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, An Act of the will inclining us to do what we conceive is proper to teſtifie our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that <hi>excellency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3ly, An outward Act, performed for the expreſſion of our Conceptions of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
            <p>Where therefore there is no intention to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our apprehenſion of any excellency in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Coroll.</note> by any Action we perform, nor is there in the Nature of the Action any ſignification or expreſſion of that excellency, there can be no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and therefore no falſe Worſhip; it being therefore evident that in wearing of a Surplice, or uſing the ſign of a <hi>Croſs,</hi> there is no Natural ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of any excellency of that God we Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor is there in us, who do uſe theſe things, any intention to expreſs our apprehenſion of any excellence in God, 'tis certain they can be no Worſhip, and therefore no falſe Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This being the Nature of Worſhip in the general, Religious Worſhip muſt be an Act or Service in its own Nature, or the intention of the Worſhipper expreſſive of ſome excellency, or perfection in the object Worſhipped. And hence our knowledg, or conceptions of God, our diſputations and diſquiſitions touching his Nature, and his attributes are no parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, tho they be terminated upon God, and he be the ſole object of them, becauſe they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs no Honour, they are not deſigned as the expreſſion of our apprehenſions of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God being the only object of Religious Worſhip, all Worſhip that is truly called <hi>Religious,</hi> muſt be either terminated on God, or ſuch as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107117:66"/>doth expreſs ſome excellency that properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto him, if it be terminated on God, and doth expreſs no excellency belonging to him, and give him no real Honour, tho it be deſigned to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, it is then Superſtitious Worſhip of God, if it expreſs ſome excellency proper to God, but terminated one the Creature, it is then <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> therefore which are not uſed with a deſign to expreſs any Honour which we owe to God, cannot be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhip, and If they do not give that Honour to the Creature which is due to God, they cannot be Idolatrous Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, Altho thoſe duties which are performed by Chriſtians, relating to the ſecond Table, <hi>viz.</hi> obedience to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> love to our Neighbours, and all the Acts of Charity, and Juſtice, are done for the <hi>Lords Sake,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and with reſpect unto Gods Glory, <hi>Matt.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</note> 5.16. and to this end <hi>they eat, and drink,</hi> and do all other Civil Actions; yet are they not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, becauſe the immediate ends of thoſe Actions is not the expreſſion of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in God, but the pleaſing of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> the doing good to our Neighbour, the refreſhing of our Bodies, that therefore any Act may properly be ſtiled <hi>Religious,</hi> it muſt proceed from a primary, direct, immediate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or intention to give Honour to God, or to expreſs our ſenſe of ſome of his perfections, or his Holy Attributes, wherefore the primary direct and the immediate intent of the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in ſubmitting to the Ceremonies being the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> Obedience to <hi>Superiours</hi> in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, he cannot rationally be ſaid to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Religious Worſhip by thus uſing them, tho he ſubmit to the injunction for the <hi>Lords
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107117:67"/>ſake,</hi> who hath commanded that obedience. And ſince the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> commands them not as immediate expreſſions, or acknowledgments of any excellency in, or Attribute of God, but partly for diſtinction, partly for decency, and uniformity, and partly for their <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and laſtly as being apt to put us in mind of our duty, they cannot be ſuppoſed by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to theſe ends to make them parts of Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, External and Bodily Worſhip is either Subſtantial, or Circumſtantial, and Ceremonial, the Subſtantial parts of Gods outward Worſhip are vocal Prayer, Praiſes, hearing of the Word, not as the word of Man, but of God, receiving of the Sacraments, as they import an entering into Covenant with God, and an <hi>Euchariſtical Oblation</hi> of our Souls and Bodies to him. Thoſe Bodily Acts which be performed by us in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of theſe ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip, and whereby we do ſignifie either our Reverence of that God in whoſe preſence we are, or with whom we have to do, as ſtanding, uncovering the head, kneeling at Prayer, bowing of our Body at our entrance into the place of Gods Worſhip, proſtration, lifting up our Hands or Eyes to Heaven, or whereby we do make profeſſion of our Faith in God, as ſtanding up at the Creed, to profeſſion of our Faith in a Crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, on which account the <hi>Ancients</hi> uſed the ſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or laſtly whereby we enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God according to his inſtitution, as by receiving of the Sacramental ſigns. All theſe are Ceremonial, or Circumſtantial parts of Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="6">6ly, Theſe Ceremonial parts of Worſhip are in the general commanded by God, and they are natural ſigns of <hi>Reverence</hi> required by the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107117:67"/>ſecond Commandment, for that forbidding all outward Religious Worſhip to be given to that which is not God, and that becauſe it is that Worſhip which is due to God, the affirmative part of that precept muſt be ſuppoſed to be this, <hi>Thou ſhalt give unto me that outward Worſhip;</hi> when therefore our <hi>Church</hi> Commands her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to <hi>Kneel</hi> at their receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Prayer; and doth exhort, but not Command them, <hi>to Worſhip God when they do enter into the place of Worſhip,</hi> or bow unto the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is <hi>God bleſſed for evermore,</hi> when they are by his Name put in Remembrance of that great Salvation which he hath wrought for us, ſhe only doth appoint that to be done at ſuch a time, which God hath in the general Commanded to be done, and ſo doth inſtitute no uncommanded part of Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="7">7ly, When any thing is by God Commanded to be done in his own Worſhip which doth not primarily, directly, and immediately tend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or ſignifie our ſenſe or apprehenſion of his excellency, or his Attributes, the doing of it in its own Nature is no part of Worſhip, but only the doing of it in Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, for all obedience is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Gods Sovereign Power, and the ſubjection which we owe unto it. Thus <hi>v. g.</hi> to receive the perſon that is to be Baptized, to give the Bread and Wine to the Communicants, are no parts of outward Worſhip, becauſe they are not directly and immediately deſigned to expreſs any excellence of God, but only done in order to the Baptiſing of the perſon to be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Church,</hi> or the convenience of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants receiving. Sitting at the receiving of the Sacrament can be no part of Worſhip in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107117:68"/>thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> which retain the geſture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is retained only as a moſt fitting Table geſture, and all thoſe things which God enjoyned to be done in his own <hi>Temple,</hi> the uſe of the <hi>Snuffers,</hi> and the <hi>Tongs,</hi> the cleanſing of the <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> the lighting up of the <hi>Candles,</hi> the bringing in of the <hi>Wood</hi> for the <hi>Burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> with infinite things of a like Nature, could be no parts of Worſhip, otherwiſe than as they were performed directly in obedience to a Divine Command. Now hence 'tis eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an Anſwer to the forementioned objections: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Hence it appears, that the proper uſe of thoſe Ceremonies of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> which are not Natural, or Inſtituted parts of Worſhip, is not the Honouring of God by the acknowledgment of any of his excellencies, which is ſufficient refutation of the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Hence it appears, that they are not meer and immediate Acts of Religion, or formally elicited from Religion, as the ſecond Argument ſuppoſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, Hence it is evident, that all the means that God hath appointed to teach Obedience are not Acts of Divine Worſhip, as Preaching, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, pious Diſcourſe, good Advice, and good Example, which is ſufficient Anſwer to the third Argument, which alſo falſly doth ſuggeſt that our Ceremonies are deviſed to that end.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, Hence it appears, that it is no part of Gods Worſhip to teach his Worſhip, teaching being an Action directed not immediately to God, but Men: nor are our Ceremonies deviſed to be means of Spiritual inſtruction by their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107117:68"/>
               <hi>Myſtical ſignification:</hi> nor are ſuch ſigns neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily eſſential parts of Worſhip, (unleſs afflictions which are ſigns of Gods diſpleaſure deſigned to be means of Spiritual inſtruction, be alſo parts of Divine Worſhip) as the fourth Argument ſuppoſeth.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, Hence it is manifeſt, that the teaching and reading of the Scriptures for edification of the <hi>Church,</hi> is no part of Gods Worſhip, for the reaſon mentioned before, on which falſe ſuppoſition doth the fifth Argument proceed.</p>
            <p n="6">6ly, Nor are all Actions whereby Spiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are taught in Gods Solemn Worſhip, Acts whereby God is Worſhipped, as is ſuggeſted in the ſixth Argument.</p>
            <p n="7">7ly, Nor was the uſe of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Solemn Worſhip of God, any part of his true and immediate Worſhip, unleſs they were ſuch <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies as did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or ſignifie ſome Divine Excellency, or the acknowledgment thereof in thoſe that uſed them, as the ſeventh Argument ſuggeſt, but doth not prove.</p>
            <p n="8">8ly, Nor are our uncommanded Ceremonies performed directly to God, as is ſuppoſed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the eighth.</p>
            <p n="9">9ly, Nor are all ſpecial things done in the Service of God parts of his Worſhip, as is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Argument the ninth.</p>
            <p n="10">10ly. Nor muſt all ſpecial Actions done in the Service of God bring ſpecial Honour to him, <hi>viz.</hi> by the ſignification of any of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, not the ſnuffing of the Candles, not the bringing of the Wood to the Temple, as the tenth Argument ſuppoſeth, ſuch Actions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed performed in order to thoſe things which do bring Honour to God, even as ſubmiſſion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107117:69"/>to the Ceremonies preſcribed by the <hi>Church</hi> is done in order to the free Preaching of the Word, and to the demonſtration of our Obedience to <hi>Superiors,</hi> and to the preſervation of the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace, by which things God is highly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
            <p n="11">11ly, All Civil Ceremonies, or all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of them, are not parts of Civil Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; not the taking of the Cup, by the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, but the Kneeling with it; not the filling out of the Wine, but the tendring it in that humble poſture. In a word, only thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies whereby we do expreſs our ſenſe of ſome excellency in our <hi>Civil Superiors,</hi> or which by Nature, or by Cuſtom ſignifie ſome excellency in the perſon to whom they are performed, are parts of <hi>Civil Worſhip.</hi> And ſo alſo is the caſe with reference to Religious Worſhip: Nor are our Ceremonies <hi>Religious,</hi> but only Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <hi>uſed in Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12ly, Nor would the Command of God to uſe a Surplice, or ſign with the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to ſignifie to the Congregation the Reception of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſon into the Society of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> make theſe Ceremonies parts of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, any otherwiſe than the doing of them would be an Act of Obedience to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and therefore the doing of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Command, can be no Worſhip, and therefore no falſe Worſhip: Nor is all that God tieth in a particular manner to his Worſhip, any part thereof.</p>

Chriſt may, as he pleaſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign his own good things that he gives us, but he conſigns no good, and repreſents none but what he alſo gives and effects in that Miniſtration, and under that Sign; but a Symbolical Rite of humane Invention to ſignify what it doeth not effect, and then introduced into the ſolemn Worſhip of God, is ſo like thoſe vain Imaginations, and Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments forbidden in the ſecond Commandment, that the very Suſpition is more againſt Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than their uſe can pretend to, and it is

            <p n="1">1. Therefore <hi>Superſtition being a ſpecies of falſe Worſhip, whereby we do exhibit Worſhip to an Object to which it is not due, or to that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which deſerveth Worſhip, in an undue manner,</hi> it follows plainly that where no Worſhip is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the act done, or intended by the Doer, or Impoſer of the act, there can be no <hi>Superſtition</hi> in the Exerciſe of ſuch an act; there may be Vanity, and an abuſe of Power in the impoſing rites unprofitable, and unneceſſary, but there can be no <hi>Superſtition,</hi> or <hi>Will Worſhip,</hi> where there is neither any act of Worſhip, nor any Will to worſhip God by the Performance of theſe Rites, nor deſignation of them unto ſuch an end.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Superſtitious Worſhip, undue as to the manner of it, can only be performed by offering that as acceptable, and pleaſing to God, or as an Exerciſe of Religion, and honor to God, or an Acknowledgment of ſome of his perfections,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107117:79"/>which is not acceptable, or well pleaſing to him, which rendreth him no honor, and doth not tend to the Acknowledgment of any of his Attributes or perfections, for by performing that which indeed is pleaſing and acceptable to God, or which doth render honor to him, we cannot be <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> hence it muſt follow that when men make thoſe things a part of their Religion which God hath not commanded, or forbidden, and think God is pleaſed with their meer doing, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from doing them, they in ſo doing muſt be ſuperſtitious. Two things are therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to compleat this ſpecies of falſe Worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the matter about which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant relate to the doing ſome ſuppoſed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Act, that is, ſome Act of Service acceptable and well pleaſing to God, and which directly tends unto his honor.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, That he who doth it do really miſtake in judging ſuch an action to be indeed Religious, and tending to his honor, and therefore acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, All Superſtition conſiſting fundamentally in this miſtake, and formally in the enſuing practice thereupon, it muſt with equal reaſon be concluded <hi>that the forbearance of an act upon the like miſtake,</hi> viz. <hi>that we conceive it well pleaſing to God, and tending to his honor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it, when indeed it is not ſo, is Superſtition,</hi> becauſe by that Forbearance we equally deſign to pleaſe and honor God, and do it as unduly with reſpect unto the manner.

<q>All Myſtical Bodily rites and ſigns of Spiritual grace adminiſtred to the <hi>Church</hi> of God in his Solemn Service, to confirm grace, and that by him who repreſents the Perſon of Chriſt, are Sacraments; but ſuch are the greateſt part of our Ceremonies, for they being Adminiſtred to Edifie the Soul and Conſcience, muſt be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to confirm grace, the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> being for this cauſe alone a Sacrament, becauſe it is a Myſtical Rite where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Soul Spiritually feedeth upon Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> is Edified in Chriſt, theſe being Myſtical Rites whereby the Soul is Edified muſt be alſo Sacraments.</q>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107117:87"/>And, when he doth uſe it, he is bound at that inſtant to profeſs, and tell why it is done, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in token that hereafter he ſhall not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that is, not be aſhamed of that Covenant whereinto he is by Baptiſm now entred: So as no Man can ſay that this is done to add either vertue to the Sacrament, or capacity of grace to the Child, but only for intimation to the whole Congregation for their inſtruction, what it is to which Baptiſm once received, binds all Chriſtians that come to age convenient; which Ceremony the Church of</hi> England <hi>thought good to retain, becauſe it had ſuch an uſe in the purer times.

                  <hi>The Arguments againſt the Rites eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England <hi>by which Diſſenters do endeavour to ſhew, that tho they may be lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet are they not to be ſubmitted to by reaſon of ſome Circumſtances which attend them, are reduced to their reſpective Heads,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>The ſuppoſed Violation of Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> 2ly, <hi>The abuſe of them by others to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry.</hi> 3ly <hi>The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Evil that is in them.</hi> 4ly, <hi>The Scandal which they miniſter to the Weak. And</hi> laſtly, <hi>That by ſubmitting to them they ſhould partake of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſin of the Impoſer,</hi> §. 1. Objection <hi>the</hi> 1ſt. <hi>They violate our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, becauſe they render us ſubject to Ordinances, which is the thing forbidden,</hi> 2 Coloſſ. 20. 2ly, <hi>The Servants of men, which is forbidden,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. 3ly, <hi>Becauſe they bind the Conſcience. And</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:107117:88"/>4ly, <hi>Becauſe they are urged on thoſe who in their Conſciences condemn them,</hi> §. 2. <hi>In anſwer to this Objection it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that the determination of any thing indifferent by our Superiors, provided they do not impoſe it as a thing neceſſary in its own Nature, or as a part of our Religious Worſhip, can no ways violate our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And that</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe Scripture layes Reſtraints upon our Liberty in matters of this Nature.</hi> 2ly, <hi>Then all our Vows and Promiſes reſpecting things indifferent relating to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, would violate our Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> 3ly, <hi>Becauſe what we may do, tho no Injunction of the Magiſtrate required it, cannot be ſin when done, becauſe he doth require it.</hi> 4ly, <hi>Then, ſhould the Magiſtrate forbid the doing of the things enjoyned, we muſt not leave undone what he forbids.</hi> 5ly, <hi>Then is it in the Power of the Magiſtrate to cut off all that Liberty we have in matters of this Nature, and to oblige us not to do what ever we are left at Liberty by God to do.</hi> 6ly, <hi>Becauſe this pretended Liberty is the occaſion of lamentable Miſchiefs to the Church of God, whereas the good which can accrue unto her Members by it, is but little.</hi> 7ly, <hi>Becauſe ſuch a pretended
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107117:88"/>Liberty is contrary to the Practice of Church Governors laid down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and to the Rules preſcribed for their Government,</hi> §. 3. Corollaries: 1. <hi>Hence it is evident, that Chriſtian Liberty cannot be violated by theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, becauſe Conſcience is bound to yield obedience to them, when they are impoſed. Nor</hi> 2. <hi>By requiring Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to do that of which their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being erroneous, doubts, or which it doth condemn. A direct Anſwer is returned.</hi> 1. <hi>To that Paſſage of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>ye are bought with a price, be not ye the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. 2ly, <hi>To that of</hi> Coloſſ. 2.20. <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the World, wherefore are ye ſubject to Ordinances?</hi> §. 4. Obj. 2. <hi>Our Ceremonies have been abuſed to Superſtition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore, being not of neceſſary uſe, ſhould be aboliſhed; and cannot be ſubmitted to without diſobedience to many Precepts of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, requiring the abolition of things ſo abuſed,</hi> §. 5. Anſw. 1. <hi>That theſe Commands were given only to the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Nation, and where no Natural Analogy, or moral reaſon can be ſhewed for their perpetual Obligation, cannot be binding to the Chriſtian, and that the contrary Tenet will be very miſchievous to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107117:89"/>Kingdoms and People. Anſ.</hi> 2. <hi>That it cannot rationally be ſuppoſed that God, by any of the Texts alledged, forbids the doing of a lawful action meerly becauſe it hath been, is, or may, by others, be abuſed to Superſtition or Idolatry, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we do not continue to be enſnared by it, nor is there any ground of fear that we ſhould be ſo;</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe this Interpretation of them would rob us of our Churches, and our Bells, and many other things which the Diſſenters do allow of.</hi> 2ly, <hi>Becauſe then many things which both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Chriſtians <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed would be unlawful.</hi> 3ly, <hi>Becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the</hi> Jews <hi>nor our Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>nor his</hi> Diſciples, <hi>did ſcruple ſuch material Conformity with Heathens in indifferent matters as our Diſſenters do condemn. Anſ.</hi> 3. <hi>That Superſtition and Idolatry can cleave no longer to ſuch Actions than the miſtake of mens opinions of them doth remain. Anſ.</hi> 4. <hi>That tho it be not neceſſary to impoſe our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet when they are impoſed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they become neceſſary in their uſe, and ſo are not to be accounted things unneceſſary in reſpect of us,</hi> §. 6. <hi>A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Anſwer is given to the Text ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;</hi> 1. <hi>By ſhewing that the things in which the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Nation are forbid to do after the manner of the</hi> Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107117:89"/>
                  <hi>or the</hi> Aegyptians, <hi>are either Idolatrous Actions or Ceremonies, or Actions tending to Idolatry, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Service of God. As in</hi> Exod. 23.24. Lev. 18.3. Deut. 12.4. <hi>Not to Name their Gods,</hi> Exod. 23.13. <hi>is not to Worſhip, enter into covenant with, or to ſwear by them.</hi> 3. <hi>The import of that Phraſe thou ſhalt call me no more</hi> Baal. Hoſ. 2.16. 4. <hi>The reaſon why God commanded his own People to deſtroy the Altars, and the Images of Heathens, and not to take unto themſelves the Silver, Gold, and other Furniture belonging to them was the prevention of their erecting of them, and preſerving them to give Idolatrous Worſhip to them, or make them Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Idolatry. As</hi> Exod. 34.13. Deut. 7.25. Eſa. 30.22. 5. <hi>Why the</hi> Jews <hi>were forbid to round the Corners of their Heads, or mar the Corners of their Beards,</hi> Lev. 19.27, 28. 6ly, 2 Cor. 6.17. <hi>Touch not the unclean thing,. And</hi> Jude. 23. <hi>Hate even the Garments ſpotted with the Fleſh, are impertinently produced againſt the uſing of our Ceremonies.</hi> 7ly, <hi>The eating of things ſacrificed to Idols condemned,</hi> Revel. 2.14.20. <hi>was only eating of them in the Idol Temples, and at the Feaſts of Idols ſo as to be Partakers
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107117:90"/>of the Table of Devils, or to commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry by the Participation of them,</hi> §. 7. Anſwer <hi>to the Examples objected, as</hi> 1. <hi>To that of</hi> Jacob <hi>cauſing his Family to give him the Ear-Rings which were in their Ears.</hi> 2ly, <hi>Of</hi> Daniel <hi>who would not defile himſelf with the portion of the Kings Meat,</hi> Dan. 1.8. 3ly, <hi>Of</hi> Mordecai <hi>refuſing to bow to</hi> Haman. 4ly, <hi>Of</hi> Hezekiah <hi>who brake the Brazen Serpent when it was abuſed to Idolatry,</hi> §. 8. Obj. 3. <hi>We muſt abſtain from all appearance of evil,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.22. <hi>Now the Ceremonies, at leaſt have an appearance of evil in them.</hi> Anſw. 1. <hi>The Words may be well rendred thus, abſtain from every ſort or kind of evil, or thus, from every appearance that is evil. A.</hi> 2. <hi>The Apoſtle only adviſeth us to abſtain from that which after tryal ſeemeth evil to our ſelves, and not from that which only doth appear to others to be evil.

            <p>I proceed therefore in the laſt place to anſwer thoſe Pretences which do, and muſt proceed on this Conceſſion, <hi>That the things required are in themſelves indifferent, and not forbidden by the Word of God,</hi> and yet they who grant this contend that they are rendred ſinful, or ſuch as they cannot with a good Conſcience do, by reaſon of ſome circumſtances which attend the Rites impoſed, the impoſition of them, or their Practice of them.</p>
            <p>And 1.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label> And 1. It is objected that the Impoſition of theſe Rites bereaves them of their <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> in reference to things indifferent, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> upon theſe ſeveral accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it doth reſtrain their Practice in matters wherein Chriſt hath left them free, and therefore, ſay they,
<q>The Apoſtle by ſaying <hi>if you be dead with Chriſt to the Rudiments of the World, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.20.</note> wherefore are ye ſubject to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107117:92"/>for otherwiſe <hi>not touching, not taſting, not handling,</hi> being things indifferent, might have been ſubmitted to:</q> And whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſtian Liberty conſiſts only in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Judgment,</hi> but not of Practice, touching matters of this Nature;
<q>We ſee, ſay they, that when the Apoſtle giveth Inſtance of ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ordinances as violate our <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> he ſaith not: <hi>You muſt not think, you may not touch,</hi> but <hi>touch not,</hi> &amp;c. Telling us, that when the Practice is reſtrained from touching, taſting, handling, by the Ordinances of Men, then is <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> violated, tho the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be left free.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Becauſe obedience to theſe Impoſitions renders us <hi>the Servants of Men,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> will not permit, ſaying: <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the Servants of Men?</hi>
               <q>Where, ſay they, the Apoſtle forbids the doing any thing for the Will and Pleaſure of Men, when our Conſcience can find no other reaſon for the doing of it, what therefore is preſs'd upon men by naked Will and Authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any reaſon to ſatisfy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be ſubmitted to, becauſe they muſt not be the <hi>Servants of Men.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> I ſhall endeavour 1. To ſhew the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of this Doctrine or Opinion, and 2ly, To anſwer what is offered to confirm it.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, that <hi>it is moſt abſurd to think and teach that the determining of any thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent relating to the Worſhip of God ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugant to our Chriſtian Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Explication of the terms of this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſider, that <hi>a thing indifferent is ſuch a thing or action which in it ſelf is neither good nor evil, neither commanded nor forbidden by God;</hi> And that <hi>to determine of ſuch actions, is to require us to do, or to omit the Practice of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Conſider that there are many actions of this Nature which muſt be done in Celebration of Gods Worſhip, tho God hath no where given Rules touching the circumſtance, and manner of performance of them. As <hi>v. g.</hi> We muſt, if we will meet for <hi>Publick Worſhip,</hi> do it in ſome <hi>place,</hi> and in ſome <hi>hour</hi> of the day, but at what place, or at what hour we ſhould meet, God hath not told us. The <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who doth officiate, muſt do it in ſome <hi>Habit,</hi> but in what Habit he ſhall do it God hath not determined. The <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who conſecrates the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> muſt conſecrate ſome Kind of Wine and Bread, but whether he ſhall conſecrate <hi>Claret,</hi> or <hi>Tent, unleavened,</hi> or <hi>leavened</hi> Bread, <hi>round Wafers,</hi> or <hi>round Loaves,</hi> or elſe <hi>flat Cakes,</hi> or <hi>Rowls,</hi> is not declared by the Word of God. The <hi>Sacrament</hi> received by the Communicant muſt be received in ſome <hi>Poſture,</hi> but whether <hi>ſtanding, ſitting,</hi> or <hi>kneeling</hi> ſhall be the Poſture, our <hi>Lord</hi> hath not informed us. To ſing in Publick is declared to be a duty,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107117:93"/>but whether we ſhall ſing in <hi>Metre,</hi> or in <hi>Proſe;</hi> with Inſtruments of <hi>Muſick,</hi> or without, <hi>plain ſong,</hi> or <hi>pricked,</hi> the Scripture gives us no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. Theſe therefore, with all matters of like Nature, already mentioned, are things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that is, neither commanded, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and they do all relate unto <hi>Gods Worſhip.</hi> And our Aſſertion is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the determination of any matters of this Nature by our Superiors, Civil, or Sacred, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do not impoſe them as things in their own Nature neceſſary, or parts of our Religious Worſhip, doth no ways violate our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> For</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Reſtraint is by the Scripture laid upon our Liberty in matters of this Nature when by the Practice of it we may <hi>ſcandalize</hi> our weak Brother, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Take heed leſt by any means this Liberty of yours become a ſtumbling block to the weak.</hi> And alſo when, by reſtraint of this our Liberty in things indifferent, we ſerve the ends of Love and Charity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Ye are called to Liberty—yet by Love ſerve one another.</hi> Why therefore may not the Authority of <hi>Gods Vicegerents,</hi> or of <hi>Chriſts Ambaſſadors,</hi> lay like reſtraints upon our Liberty in matters of this Nature? Why may we not do that for Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Love to them, which Love unto our <hi>Neighbour</hi> requires us to perform? why ſhould we not be careful that our <hi>Superiors</hi> be not <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized,</hi> as by our <hi>diſobedience</hi> to them in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matters they will be, as well as that we do not <hi>ſcandalize</hi> our <hi>weaker Brother.</hi> Since by abſtaining from any thing indifferent for fear of giving <hi>ſcandal</hi> to, or out of Love to others, a <hi>reſtraint</hi> is put upon our <hi>Liberty of Practiſing theſe things,</hi> as well as by the Precepts of <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:107117:94"/>why ſhould the one be deem'd more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> than is the other?</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Were this reſtraint in matters of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency relating to the Service of God, a Violation of our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> than all our <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> reſpecting things indifferent, relating to the Service of God, muſt be a Violation of that <hi>Liberty,</hi> ſince by them we <hi>reſtrain our Freedom as to thoſe matters,</hi> as much as 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Commands of our <hi>Superiors</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording therefore unto this opinion, ſhould I vow to keep a faſt in <hi>Lent,</hi> to <hi>kneel</hi> at the Receiving of the Sacrament, to ſet apart a Room in my own houſe for <hi>private Devotion,</hi> or to do any other thing relating to the Service of God which he hath not determined, I could not be obliged to perform thoſe Vows, as being Violations of my <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi>

            <p n="3">3ly, That which I may do, tho no Injunction of the Magiſtrate required it of me, cannot be therefore ſin when done, becauſe he doth require it, but any thing indifferent relating to Gods Worſhip may be done by me, tho no Injunction of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> required it, for if it be a thing indifferent, it cannot be forbidden, and what is not forbidden, it cannot be unlawful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; now to aſſert that what I lawfully may do, muſt be my ſin, if done becauſe the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> commands it, is in effect to ſay what is the plaineſt Contradiction, <hi>viz. That 'tis unlawful to yield obedience to Gods Vicegerents in any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matter.</hi> Moreover thô the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould not determine in matters of this Nature, if we will practiſe any of theſe duties, we muſt our ſelves determine of them; <hi>v. g.</hi> If we will meet for Publick Worſhip, we muſt appoint <hi>ſome
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107117:94"/>time,</hi> and <hi>place</hi> in which to do it, if we will mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in Sacred Things, we muſt be clothed with <hi>ſome Habit,</hi> a cloak, a gown, or ſurplice, which we do thus miniſter. If we will conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the Sacrament, we muſt determine upon <hi>ſome kind</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> in which to do it, and if we will receive the Sacrament, we muſt pitch upon <hi>ſome Poſture</hi> in which we will receive, if we will ſing, it muſt be done in <hi>Proſe,</hi> or <hi>Meire,</hi> and the like. If therefore a neceſſity doth lie upon us to determine in matters of this Nature before we do perform them, how can it be a Violation of our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> for the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi> Power to do that which we muſt do our ſelves, and which when once the <hi>Miniſter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines for himſelf, the Peoples Liberty is equally reſtrained, as it would be by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their <hi>Superior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4ly, If by impoſing of theſe things indifferent relating to Gods Service, which we may leave undone, the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſo violates our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> that we may not do them, becauſe he thereby doth reſtrain our Liberty of leaving theſe things undone, then by like reaſon ſhould the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> forbid the doing of the things enjoyned, we muſt not leave undone what he forbids, becauſe he thereby doth reſtrain our Liberty of doing of theſe things, for it is eaſy to perceive that 'tis as great a Violation of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to have indifferent things forbidden us, as to have them commanded, that 'tis no leſs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochment on our Liberty to be tyed up from what we antecedently to the Command of our <hi>Superiors</hi> might do, as to be bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what we might omit. If then <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> think themſelves obliged to refuſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to theſe things indifferent becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107117:95"/>by the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> 'tis but forbidding them to yield obedience to them, and then, by their own Principle, they muſt become exact <hi>Conformiſts.</hi> Now is not this a Fooliſh Liberty which tends to make men humourſome and croſs to their <hi>Superiors,</hi> ſo that what he deſires they ſhould do he muſt forbid, what he deſires they ſhould leave undone, he muſt command, if this be worthy of the name of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> let any Reaſonable Perſon judge.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, If by impoſing of a thing indifferent, relating to the Service of God, the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> doth violate our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and we ſtand bound not to obey, or to perform the thing commanded, then is it in the power of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> to cut off all that Liberty we have in matters of this Nature, and to oblige us not to do what ever we are left at Liberty by God to do, as <hi>v. g.</hi> If he commands us to meet for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Worſhip at ſuch a <hi>place, or time,</hi> we muſt be bound to do it at <hi>another place</hi> and <hi>time.</hi> If he commands the Miniſter to conſecrate <hi>ſuch Wine and Bread,</hi> he muſt be bound to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate <hi>ſome other kind of Bread and Wine.</hi> If he require the people to <hi>ſtand,</hi> or <hi>ſit,</hi> at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, they muſt be bound to <hi>kneel,</hi> or uſe <hi>ſome other Poſture,</hi> and ſo in other caſes of like Nature. So that this Doctrine puts it into the power of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain both our Conſciences, and Practices in matters of this Nature, and to determine them to one, and ſo to take away that Liberty which is ſo eagerly contended for. And</p>
            <p n="6">6ly, This pretended Liberty is the occaſion of lamentable miſchiefs to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whereas the good which can accrue unto her Members by it is but little, the diſadvantage
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107117:95"/>they can ſuffer by the want thereof is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. We can receive but little good by ſuch a Liberty from the Commands of our <hi>Superiors</hi> in things indifferent, becauſe they being ſuch, if we do them <hi>we are not the better,</hi> or more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and <hi>if we do them not we are not the worſe,</hi> or the leſs pleaſing to him, for otherwiſe they could not rationally be ſtiled things indifferent; If then our Freedom from obedience in ſuch matters can only be a Freedom of doing or omitting that which, whether we omit or do, we are neither worſe, nor better, what good can we receive by ſuch a Freedom? what diſadvantage by the want thereof? Is it not the whole deſign of the Goſpel to make us obedient to the Laws of Chriſt, to make us holy, and free from the Dominion and the Power of ſin? and may we not be therefore certain that thoſe actions which are neither good nor evil in themſelves, neither commanded nor forbidden by Chriſt, and therefore no way tend to the obſtructing our obedience to Chriſt, our Holineſs of life, or to the depraving of our Souls, and bringing them in bondage to ſin, cannot be prejudicial to any intereſt or deſign of Chriſtian Doctrine, whether they be performed or omitted? Now is it not abſurd to think our Lord ſhould purchaſe for his <hi>Church</hi> a Liberty to diſobey <hi>Superiors</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherein their obedience would bring no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to them, their diſobedience will do them no good? Moreover our obedience to our <hi>Superiors</hi> in ſuch matters, viſibly doth rend to the promoting Love, Peace, Unity, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Self denyal, orderly Walking, and ſuch like <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Virtues, and therefore it is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have purchaſed our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from it. Our diſobedience, as we by ſad
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107117:96"/>experience ſee, doth tend to the promoting Schiſms, Diſſentions, Uncharitableneſs, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, Wrath, Strife, Contention, it procures <hi>Strokes for the Backs of Fools,</hi> expoſes both the Perſons, and Families of diſobedient Perſons to temporal and ſpiritual Evils, it excludes them from Sacred Ordinances, and the Communion of the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore ſuch a Liberty from doing things not evil, or diſpleaſing to God, muſt be ſo far from being worthy of our <hi>Saviours</hi> purchaſe, that it doth contradict his great Deſign, that Love, Peace, Union might flouriſh in his <hi>Church,</hi> and that the contrary fruits of the fleſh, might be entirely baniſhed from among his Members.</p>
            <p n="7">7ly, Such a pretended Liberty is contrary to the Practice of the <hi>Church Governors</hi> laid down in Scripture, and to the Rules preſcribed for their Government; 'tis contrary to that Liberty the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> did exerciſe, as I have ſhewed already in many inſtances of things no where determined by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet enjoyned by them, 'tis alſo contrary to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Practice, who forbad the uſing of things ſtrangled and blood, tho they not only were things in themſelves indifferent, but things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by that Ceremonial Law from which our Lord had freed his Servants, and therefore more might have been pleaded againſt ſubmitting unto that Decree, than to the Conſtitutions of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> concerning other things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires that all things which relate unto Gods Publick Worſhip, of which he there diſcourſeth, ſhould be done <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>orderly,</hi> but how ſhall <hi>Rulers</hi> be able to order matters ſo, if it be an Infringement of our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> to have any thing impoſed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107117:96"/>upon us by our <hi>Governours</hi> for decency and orders ſake? Particular Rules being not given us in Scripture about this matter, which to be ſure would have been done, were they not left to the determination of the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Wherefore to give a brief, but a ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objections mentioned,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> 1. From what hath been diſcourſed it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Chriſtian Liberty cannot be violated by theſe Impoſitions, becauſe the Conſcience is obliged by them, that is, 'tis bound to yield obedience to them when they are impoſed; for if this maketh the Commands of our <hi>Superiors</hi> to violate our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> Then 1. All the Commands of <hi>Maſters, Parents</hi> and <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors</hi> reſpecting things indifferent, civil or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, muſt be repugnant to that Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are, if Servants, Children or Subjects, obliged to obey them in all lawful matters, even <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> 2ly, Then our own vows, and reſolutions concerning any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, muſt violate our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> becauſe we are obliged in Conſcience to perform them. 3ly, Then can we not abſtain from any thing indifferent in caſe of <hi>Scandal,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> Commands us, without infringing of our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> becauſe our Conſcience is then bound, for fear of <hi>Scandal,</hi> to abſtain from what is in it ſelf indifferent.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, It alſo is exceeding evident that <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty</hi> cannot be violated by requiring Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to do that of which their Conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing erroneous, doubts, or which it doth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, as is inſinuated in the fourth Objection. For were this ſo, Then 1. our Laws muſt violate true <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> when they command the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to pay Tythes,</hi> for he not only doubts the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107117:97"/>lawfulneſs thereof, but peremptorily pronounceth it unlawful ſo to do. Then 2ly, our Laws Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all <hi>Papiſts</hi> to come to <hi>Church,</hi> to obey the <hi>King</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to take the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> muſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> becauſe he doubts the lawfulneſs of yielding obedience to them. 3ly, By the ſame Rule my <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> muſt be infring'd much more, when <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to abſtain from what my Conſcience tells me I ſhould do; now ſeeing an Erroneous Conſcience may urge Men to the greateſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, ſince it may make them <hi>verily believe they ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus, Acts</hi> 26.9. and that by killing his <hi>Diſciples, they would do God Service, Joh.</hi> 16.2. no Laws according to this Doctrine, can be laid on Men whoſe Conſcience is Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to, bind them not to do the worſt of Evils.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, In Anſwer to that paſſage of St. <hi>Paul, we are bought with a Price,</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

But 2ly, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reading, and interpretation of them, viz. <hi>ye are bought with a Price,</hi> even with the Blood of <hi>Chriſt, be ye not the Servants of Men;</hi> it giveth no Commiſſion to the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to refuſe obedience to his <hi>Superiors</hi> in lawful matters, for to be <hi>the Servants of Men,</hi> which is the thing forbidden to <hi>Chriſts Servants,</hi> is only not to yield obedience to Men in any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to that Service which they owe to <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore it is ſo far from being prejudicial to that obedience we owe unto <hi>Superiors for the Lords ſake,</hi> that for this very reaſon we are required to obey them in all lawful things, becauſe 'tis part of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which <hi>Christ</hi> requires from us as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and which we are required to do <hi>for the Lords ſake:</hi> So Col. 3.20. <hi>Children obey

            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In Anſwer to that enquiry of St. <hi>Paul, If you be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the World, <note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks not there of Rites, or Conſtitutions required by <hi>Authority,</hi> and owned as things indifferent in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of <hi>Doctrins, Dogma's,</hi> and Commands of <hi>Jews,</hi> and of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and <hi>falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> who could have no <hi>Authority</hi> to require from them ſubmiſſion to theſe Doctrines, and Commands, but on ſuppoſal of the goodneſs, and excellency of the things Commanded: He therefore ſpeaketh of ſuch things as the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> could not be Subject to on any grounds but ſuch as in themſelves were <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and were reproachful to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of it, as repreſenting him deficient in wiſdom by his neglecting to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107117:98"/>Command things ſo exceeding good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, The things here mentioned are manifeſtly things which, in the judgment of theſe <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſers,</hi> were things by which God would be better Worſhipped, and his Religion be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or the Profeſſors of it would be rendred more Perfect and Sublime, and for neglect of which they were to be Condemned, tho no <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of Man did interpoſe for their injunction, as will be evident.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From this conſideration, that they were things for the neglect of which the <hi>falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> did condemn the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as is inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in theſe words, <hi>let no Man judg,</hi> cenſure, or condemn, <hi>you in meats or in drinks,</hi> v. 16. yea they were things for want of which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> it ſelf was repreſented as imperfect, and inferior in Wiſdom to the <hi>Promoters</hi> of theſe inſtitutions; whence the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in oppoſition to theſe <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> declares that <hi>in Chriſt were hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> v. 3. and adds, that <hi>this I ſay, leſt any Man ſhould belie you with inticing words,</hi> v. 4. Hence he exhorts them to <hi>beware leſt any Man ſpoil them through Philoſophy and vain Deceit, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.</note> after the Traditions of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt,</hi> and gives this reaſon of his caution, that <hi>in him did all fulneſs dwell,</hi> and that <hi>we were compleat in him.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 23</note> 2ly, Becauſe theſe things are ſtiled <hi>Will-Worſhip,</hi> they therefore who did introduce them muſt look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as things conducing to the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice of God, or the advancement of his Worſhip. 3ly, Becauſe they who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them did it out of pretence of that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Auſterity</hi> which they

            <p n="7">7ly, When the Jews are forbid to <hi>round the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their Heads, or mar the corners of their Beards,</hi> they only are forbid that rounding of the corners of their heads which was done in honour of <hi>Demons,</hi> and that marring of the corners of their Beards, which <hi>Heathen</hi> Prieſts uſed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Idols, <hi>Baruch</hi> 6.31. <hi>Their Prieſts ſit in their Temples having their Heads and their Beards ſhaven.</hi> And therefore this making baldneſs upon their Heads, this ſhaving of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107117:105"/>Corners of their Beards, is forbidden as that whereby they would profane the name of God, and as oppoſite to owning God to be their Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.6.19.25, 28. Moreover that cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Fleſh which God forbids in the ſame place, for the ſame reaſons, was the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Fleſh for the dead, which was by <hi>Heathens</hi> uſed partly from <hi>Superſtition,</hi> Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficari ſe aliquo modo defunctis putantes, <hi>Thereby conceiving that they did ſome way gratifie the dead,</hi> and partly from Idolatry, to appeaſe the <hi>Infernal Deities.</hi> And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that printing marks upon their Fleſh, which the ſame Text forbids, was ſuch, <hi>Quâ ſe ad Idololatriam ſignabant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they marked themſelves for the ſervice of ſuch or ſuch an Idol,</hi> ſaith <hi>Maimonides;</hi> ſo that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all theſe paſſages is only this; Thou ſhalt not by any of theſe ways make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Idolatry, or an acknowledgment of <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> or uſe thoſe Cuſtoms which in their common uſe do ſignifie the owning of them. And if the naming of their Gods, the ſhaving of their Beards or Heads in ſuch a manner, had been abſolutely forbidden, and not only as Teſtimonies of Idolatry, I know not why they ſhould concern us more than the Prohibition of a Linſey-Woolſey Garment, or the ſowing of their Fields with divers Seeds, which no Man thinks unlawful to be done by <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p n="8">8ly, To the Objection from theſe words mentioned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. viz. <hi>Touch not the unclean thing,</hi> I Anſwer, that it cannot in the leaſt concern our Ceremonies; for, what in them, thus purged from <hi>Popiſh Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> can be eſteemed the unclean thing? Is it the thing it ſelf? What can the abuſe of other
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107117:106"/>Men defile to our uſe the very Nature of things which God hath not made to us unclean? How then ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>to the clean all things are clean?</hi>

               <q>But if they ſhall grant that the uncleanneſs is in the Superſtitious abuſe of ſuch things, then let them know that he who uſeth the ſame thing without the ſame, or other Superſtition, may be ſaid to touch the thing, but not to touch the unclean thing, as he that touched <hi>Naaman</hi> cleanſed from his <hi>Leproſie,</hi>
               </q> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Man, but not the ſame Leper. 2ly, The command to be ſeparated, and touch not the unclean thing, is made the condition of Gods <hi>receiving us,</hi>

And 3ly, What is here, not to touch the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, is only <hi>to purge our ſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> as is evident from the context of the words, for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mentioned the promiſes God had made to thoſe who did ſeparate themſelves, and touch not the unclean thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God would receive them, and be a Father to them,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <hi>wherefore beloved let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh</hi> and Spirit, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.1.

            <p>It therefore is erroneouſly ſaid that our action, <note place="margin">Coroll.</note> tho it may diſpleaſe, yet cannot miniſter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Scandal to both parties, for tho 'tis true, I cannot give a <hi>just</hi> occaſion of offence by doing, or omitting the ſame action, for then I muſt lie under a neceſſity of ſinning, it being neceſſary for me either to do, or to omit the doing of it.

            <p n="2">2ly, It will not follow hence, that they do ill in not determining all things indifferent that ſo no danger may be left of giving of offence by the uſe of them. Becauſe the remedy may be much worſe than the Diſeaſe, as being 1.

            <p n="1">1. That no Mans Conſcience can tell him certainly that he will, but only that he may Scandalize his Brother by conforming to the Commands of his <hi>Superiors,</hi> and it may alſo tell him that he is in danger to Scandalize them more by not conforming, and in this Caſe the Plea holds good, the Scandal being equal on both ſides; I durſt not diſobey <hi>Superiors</hi> againſt a plain Command, and to the manifeſt dividing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing of the Church, to avoid the Scandal of a weak Brother, ariſing not from my action, but his ignorance.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107117:118"/>Nature and conſequences of the offence, and would accordingly have given his directions, and and ſo accordingly do we. To the ſecond Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Would not good Chriſtians ſtill had care of their Brothers Conſciences?</hi> Anſwer, They would have ſhewed their care both of their Brothers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and their own, by giving him by their example no occaſion to diſobey thoſe that Ruled over them in Lawful matters, to the dividing and the diſturbing of the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace.

I fear this will be found at the laſt day too true, that he doth Criminally Scandalize, who doth, or who enjoyneth that which is unneceſſary and which he knows will through the weakneſs of his Brother Miniſter occaſion of his ſin and ruine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no benefit from what he doth require or do, equal unto the miſchief which it doth to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, It is ſaid by Dr. <hi>Womack, that Scandal is an action done with intent to enſnare Men in ſin, <note place="margin">Melius Inquir. <hi>p.</hi> 106.</note> or ſet up as a Mouſe-Trap on purpoſe to entrap them;</hi> whence it will follow that no Man in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity can ſay that by the Ceremonies, we Scandalize our weak Brother, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Charitably judg that theſe Ceremonies are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with an intent to draw Men to ſin.

            <p n="2">2ly, He who doth venture on that action whence he either doth or may know ſuch offence will
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107117:121"/>follow, as truly may be guilty of the Scandal following, as if he had intended it, becauſe by doing of it without neceſſity, and with ſuch knowledge, he may be virtually ſaid to intend it, tho actually he doth not ſo. 3ly, The ſecret intention of the agent doth not make the offended Perſon leſs or more ſubject unto fall, ſin, and ruine, and ſo it cannot hinder the ſinfulneſs of the offence which, he may eaſily foreſee, will follow from it; wherefore <hi>Spalato</hi> doth determin well, <note place="margin">De Rep.

A Scandal is of a Soul deſtroying Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. and who ſo wicked and malicious upon the face of the Earth whoſe Soul a true Chriſtian Charity will exclude from its care, mercy, and compaſſion, or who ſo wicked as to add to his ruine? 2ly, The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> motive reacheth to the wicked and <hi>Malicious,</hi> viz. <hi>deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died,</hi> for they may be in the number of thoſe for whom Chriſt died, who for their preſent ſtate and condition are moſt <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> and wicked. 3ly, We are obliged to love all, even our moſt <hi>Malicious</hi> and <hi>perſecuting Enemies, Matt.</hi> 5.44. we are <hi>to do good to all, Gal.</hi> 6.10. we are to exerciſe patience, and meekneſs even <hi>towards thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14, 15. and whom then may we Scandalize. 4ly, The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were the moſt <hi>Malicious</hi> Enemies of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle give no offence to Jew or
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107117:122"/>Gentile,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. 5ly, Doth not our <hi>Saviour</hi> forgo his Liberty to pleaſe the Malicious, as when he payed Tibute, leſt he ſhould offend them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.27. they were Malicious at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſeekers of occaſion againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> that were likely to be offended at his taking wages there, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12. yet, the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no neceſſary Duty, he thinketh it his Duty to forbear his power therein. And whereas againſt this it is objected, that our Lord did not regard the Scandal of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but ſaid <hi>let them alone, Matt.</hi> 15.12, 13, 14. this Anſwer is returned by <hi>Parker: If this be all the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant we have not to forbear in a thing indifferent for the Malicious, than have we no Warrant at all, becauſe the Scandal there not cared for, is when the Phariſees were offended at his abſtaining from their waſhings, and Preaching a true Doctrine, both of which were neceſſary Duties for him to do, and when he defendeth his healing on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and his diſciples plucking of the Ears of Corn, upon this reaſon that</hi> they were Duties <hi>of</hi> neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>and Charity, he plainly inſinuates that there is no defence for deeds unneceſſary when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious are offended.</hi>

               <q>IN the laſt place it is objected that their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the impoſed Rites will render them <hi>purtakers of the ſin of others,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be done.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>We dare not joyn with you, ſay they, in Publick Worſhip, or the participation of the Holy Sacraments: Becauſe ſome things are by <hi>Superiors</hi> required of all thoſe who are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to joyn with you in thoſe Ordinances, which tho they are not evil in themſelves, yet ought they not to be required as the conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, they being things unneceſſary; now ſhould we, ſay they, yield obedience to them in theſe things, we ſhould countenance them in their impoſing theſe unneceſſary burthens upon others, and harden them in that which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be their ſin, and ſhould encourage their perſiſtance in it, and ſo ſhould be partakers in that Guilt: Moreover the Rigid impoſition of theſe things, ſay they, tends to divide the Church to make men Schiſmaticks, and ſo it miniſters to the deſtruction of poor Souls; we dare not therefore ſubmit unto the practiſe of them, leſt by ſo doing we approve of thoſe Unchriſtian practices.</q> To this pretence I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Retorting of the Argument; for the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of obedience to <hi>Superiors</hi> in Lawful matters hath the like and more pernitious conſequences,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107117:124"/>and therefore, they at leaſt have equal cauſe to yield obedience to ſuch conſtitutions of <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> on this account, leſt by refuſing that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they approve the more Unchriſtian practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe who rend the <hi>Church,</hi> deſert Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her, Schiſmatically ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, diſturb the Unity, the Peace, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Edification of her Members, and caſt a vile reproach upon <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it as that which doth forbid obedience to <hi>Superiors</hi> in Lawful matters, and harden others in theſe ſins; all which is manifeſtly done by their refuſal to obey the Conſtitutions of <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> in Lawful matters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Did our Submiſſion to any thing which our <hi>Superiors</hi> ſhould not command, make us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their ſin, then every Burthenſome and Grievous <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> which after it is made, tends more unto the prejudice, then to the good of the Community, not only Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might, but muſt be diſobeyed <hi>for Conſcience ſake,</hi> leſt by ſubmitting to it we ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our <hi>Superiors</hi> to impoſe Grievous burthens on the Subject, ſo that this ſcruple will lead to <hi>Faction</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> as well as to <hi>Sedition</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And 2ly, If this were ſo that by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to any thing Commanded by <hi>Superiors</hi> which we do not approve of, or they ſhould not impoſe, we become Guilty of the Sin of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,</hi> then muſt our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> be Guilty of like ſin, for they did ordinarily joyn with the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice on the Sabbath day, and at their other <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals,</hi> as I have ſhewed already, altho they, who then <hi>ſat in</hi> Moſes <hi>chair,</hi> impoſed more Rites and Ceremonies to be obſerved in thoſe parts of Publick Worſhip, then are impoſed in our

               <hi>Church.</hi> 3ly. Then alſo muſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> be Guilty of approving thoſe who did impoſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies as neceſſary to be obſerved by the <hi>Jew</hi> converted to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe, for peace ſake, he himſelf ſubmittedto them, and <hi>to the</hi> Jew <hi>became as a</hi> Jew <hi>that he might gain the</hi> Jew: He alſo muſt himſelf approve, and adviſe others to approve the judgment, and the practice of thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> who thought the Meats forbidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> unlawful to be eaten, the days appointed by that Law, ſtill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved, becauſe he did himſelf, and he adviſed others to comply with them in their weakneſs, or to abſtain from eating of thoſe meats when that would miniſter occaſion of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to their weak Brethren, and ſo, according to the Grounds of this objection, he himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and hard'ned other perſons in their ſin, and he adviſed others ſo to do.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> 3ly, To give more ample ſatisfaction to this ſcruple, I ſhall conſider all the ways whereby we become guilty of the ſin of others, and then apply them to the caſe in hand.</p>
            <p>We therefore may become partakers of the ſin of others either directly, when we do actually conſent unto, will, or approve the evil action which is done by others, or <hi>indirectly,</hi> when tho we do not actually conſent unto the ſin of others, yet do we that which is a culpable occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Directly,</hi> when we do actually conſent unto, will, or approve the ſin of others: Now this is done two ways, 1. <hi>Antecedently</hi> to the Evil action, as when 'tis done by our command, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or perſwaſion, or <hi>conſequently,</hi> when tho we had no hand in doing of it, yet we do afterwards cenſent unto, approve or do rejoyce in any Evil done by others.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:107117:125"/>2ly, <hi>Directly</hi> we partake with others in their ſin, and <hi>Antecedently</hi> are guilty of it, when having power over them, we do command the doing of it, for this Command is a plain evidence that we do will the Evil action, and deſire that it may be done: Thus <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſlew <hi>Amnon,</hi> becauſe he commanded his ſervants, ſaying, <hi>when I ſay unto you ſmite</hi> Amnon, <hi>then kill him, fear not, have not I Commanded you?</hi> 2 Sam. 13.30.28. thus <hi>David numbred the People,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.10. by commanding <hi>Joab</hi> ſo to do, <hi>v.</hi> 4. He <hi>kill'd</hi> Uriah <hi>the Hittite with the Sword,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.9. becauſe at the command of <hi>David</hi> he was <hi>put into the front of the Battel that he died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3ly, We are directly partakers with another in his ſin, and <hi>Antecedently</hi> are guilty of it, when we perſwade, encourage, warrant, allure, or ſet him on to the performance of it, for by all theſe actions we ſhew that we are willing and deſirous that the ſin be done, which in the ſight of God is to commit it: Thus <hi>Jeroboam made Iſrael to ſin</hi> by providing his <hi>two Golden Calves,</hi> and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, <hi>it is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>behold thy Gods O Iſrael, which brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28, 30. and <hi>chap.</hi> 13.34. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8.</note> thus the <hi>chief Rulers crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> tho the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> did it, becauſe <hi>they ſought falſe witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him,</hi> Matt. 26.59. they pronounced him <hi>guilty of death,</hi> v. 66. <hi>they perſwaded the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to ask</hi> Barabbas, <hi>and deſtroy</hi> Jeſus, Matt. 27, 20. Thus did the People <hi>kill the Prince of Peace,</hi> Act. 3.15. Becauſe they, hearkning to theſe perſwaſions of the <hi>chief Prieſts,</hi> cryed out to <hi>Pontius Pilate, let him be crucified:</hi> thus alſo are we guilty of the ſin of others upon the ſame account, by counſelling, or by adviſing them
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107117:126"/>to what is Evil, by conſenting to, or by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it before 'tis done.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, We are directly partakers with another in his ſin, and become guilty of it <hi>conſequentially,</hi> when we conſent unto, or do approve the Evil done, when we applaud the action, or rejoyce that it is done, becauſe in all theſe caſes we ſhew our willingneſs, that what is Evil ſhould be done. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>He</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, who bids</hi> the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>good ſpeed</hi> is partaker of his Evil deeds, for by this wiſh he ſheweth his good liking to his Hereſie, expreſſing his deſire that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper and prevail, whence it muſt follow by like reaſon, that whoſoever doth approve, or ſhew good liking to, or doth deſire, or wiſh that they may proſper, or prevail who are engaged in a wicked action, become partakers of its guilt. Hence is he charged as one <hi>who hates inſtruction and caſts Gods Law behind his back, who when he ſeeth a Thief conſenteth to him,</hi> Pſal. 50.18. and this is made an aggravation of the guilt of <hi>Heathens,</hi> that <hi>knowing the judgment of God that they who did ſuch things were worthy of death, they not only did the ſame, but had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them that did them,</hi> Rom. 1.32. The reaſon is, becauſe he who doth praiſe an Evil action, doth approve it as good, and worthy of his commendation, and therefore ſhews that he is willing that it ſhould be done, and ſo doth alſo he who doth rejoyce at, or taketh pleaſure in the commiſſion of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, They do, almoſt in all theſe ways, incur the guilt of others ſins who teach falſe Doctrines which do encourage others in a courſe of ſin, who plead for that as good, and Righteous, which is Wicked, and teach that to be innocent and harmleſs, which indeed is ſinful, and ſo
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107117:126"/>incur the Wo denounced againſt them <hi>who call evil good, and good evil, Eſa.</hi> 5.20. for that by ſuch erroneous Doctrines Men may in all theſe ways contract the guilt of others ſins, is evident from this conſideration, that if Men call evil good, they by ſo doing muſt encourage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and warrant others to commit it, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them in their wicked practices, and if they call good evil, they muſt deter them from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Duty, and muſt encourage them to ſin by the neglect of that performance. And therefore they who do deter Men from joyning with our Congregations, as being guilty of <hi>Superſtitious Worſhip,</hi> or doing things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the word of God, if they prove guilty in this matter of falſe accuſation, as I think they are, muſt be partakers of that Schiſm which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, reſting on their judgments, are encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make, for they muſt then Command them not to do what 'tis their Duty, in obedience to their <hi>Superiors,</hi> and love unto their <hi>Churches</hi> Peace, and Unity, to do, and muſt encourage them in and praiſe them for that diſobedience, and Separation which is indeed their ſin. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> 
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly, We become indirectly guilty of the ſin of others, when tho we do not actually conſent unto, or will their ſin, nor have we any purpoſe or deſign to tempt them to it, or enſnare them in it, yet do we that which is a culpable occaſion of their ſin, and where 'tis through our fault that others ſin, we cannot be wholly excuſed from the guilt of their iniquity: Now thus we may be charged with the ſin of others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By neglecting of that Duty, or by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that Evil action which doth directly give occaſion to the ſin of others, for moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſin which doth immediately happen
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107117:127"/>through my neglect of Duty, or is the plain reſult of my Tranſgreſſion, muſt be mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For even <hi>Heathens</hi> have declared, that <hi>qui non vetat peccare cum poteſt, jubet, He that when he hath Power to reſtrain Men from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Evil, and hath Authority from God committed to him for that end, neglects to do it, he becomes guilty of thoſe ſins which through neglect of his Authority, and Duty, others do commit;</hi> thus, <hi>If the Watch-man do not warn the ſinner, who dies in his iniquity, his Blood will be required at the Watch-mans hands,</hi> Ezek. 33. v. 8. Thus the iniquity of <hi>Eli</hi>'s <hi>Sons</hi> is charged upon him, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe they made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</hi> And ſince it is the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Duty to admoniſh his offending Brother, and not to ſuffer ſin upon him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he by neglecting of this Duty becomes guilty of his ſin; hence we thus Read, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt reprove thy Brother, and not bear ſin for him,</hi> or that thou be not puniſhed for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Now where the Righteous judg doth threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to puniſh us for other Mens Tranſgreſſions, we may be ſure that we are truly guilty of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, We become <hi>indirectly</hi> guilty of the ſin of others, when by our ill example we miniſter occaſion to their ſin, and by our freedom to commit an Evil action, we encourage others, tho we do not intend it, to commit the like, for hereby we, at leaſt, if we be perſons of <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and credit, do put a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall in our Brothers way, and therefore <hi>walk not Charitably,</hi> nor ſutably unto that Precept which Commands us <hi>to give none offence to Jew or Gentile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3ly, We become <hi>indirectly</hi> guilty of the ſin of others, when we do uſe our liberty in things
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107117:127"/>indifferent to the offence, or ſin of our weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>i. e.</hi> when, tho we know that our weak Brother is like to be offended, or tempted by our practice of that indifferentaction to do evil, we will not, tho we have it in our power ſo to do, abſtain from the performance of it: Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth exhort all Chriſtians <hi>to take heed leſt by uſing of their Liberty in matters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they become a ſtumbling block to thoſe that are weak,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.9. <hi>That no Man put a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way,</hi> Rom. 14.13. declaring <hi>it is good neither to eat Fleſh, nor to drink Wine, nor to do any other thing by which their Brother is offended, or made weak,</hi> Rom. 14.21. that tho all meats are pure, and lawful to be eaten, yet <hi>is it evil for that Man who eateth with offence,</hi> v. 20. that <hi>if our Brother be grieved with our meat we walk not Charitably towards him,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of the like import, whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that in all matters of indifferency, it is the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Duty, as much as in him lies, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the cauſing of his Brothers ſin by uſing of his Liberty in doing of them, and therefore that he muſt incur the guilt of ſin by the neglect of this his Duty. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> Now to apply theſe things to the caſe in hand it will appear by a ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the forementioned ways which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us partakers of the ſins of others, that our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to things lawful in themſelves, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Superiors,</hi> cannot involve us in the guilt of the <hi>Impoſer,</hi> altho he ſhould offend in the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing them as the conditions of Communion; For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By our ſubmiſſion to theſe Conſtitutions for the ſake of Peace, and to prevent the Schiſms, and the Diviſions of the <hi>Church</hi> of God, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be ſaid to command the impoſing

Nor 3ly, can we be ſaid to conſent unto, or rejoyce in, or praiſe the action of <hi>Impoſers,</hi> this only can be truly ſaid that we conſent unto the uſing of, or to ſubmiſſion to them for the forementioned pious ends, tho not to the impoſing of them; all which is evident from this conſideration, that many do, and have conſented to the uſing of them, who have remonſtrated, and declared their judgments againſt the impoſition of them, and all have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do ſo, now ſure that action which may be done, tho we declare by word or writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impoſition of theſe things, can be no virtual conſent unto, or approbation of that impoſition, or any encouragement to others to continue ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, We cannot be partakers of the ſuppoſed guilt of others in this matter indirectly, by the neglecting of our Duty: Not by neglecting of our power to reſtrain <hi>Superiors</hi> from thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, for we have no ſuch power over them, but are commanded to be ſubject to them in all lawful matters, even for Conſcience ſake; nor from neglect of any Duty incumbent on us to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our <hi>Superiors</hi> of the ſuppoſed fault in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to impoſe theſe things, for they who do conceive this is their Duty, may with all due ſubmiſſion to, and reverence of their <hi>Superiors,</hi> diſcharge that Duty by humbly offering the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their judgment in that caſe, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding may ſubmit unto the things enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ends forementioned. Nor 3ly, Can we be thus guilty by any ill example or Evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which gives occaſion to their ſin, for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Commands of our <hi>Superiors</hi> in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107117:128"/>lawful matters is not Evil, nor can we be obliged to abſtain from, but rather to perform that action.</p>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We cannot indirectly be partakers of the ſin of others by uſing this our Liberty in things indifferent to the offence of our weak Brother. For 1. The action in which we are obliged not to miniſter to the offence of our weak Brother muſt be indifferent, not only in its own Nature, but alſo in reſpect to us, that is, there muſt be no command or obligation by <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors</hi> laid upon us to the practice of it: For, when the caſe ſtands thus, we are not to refrain obedience to Authority to avoid the Scandal of our weak Brother, except in caſes wherein it may be rationally preſumed that our <hi>Superiors</hi> would permit us ſo to do. The reaſon is, becauſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Authority</hi> in lawful matters is a moral Duty, and the neglect thereof is ſin, ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to neglect our Duty, or commit ſin to gratifie our Brother in his weakneſs, he cannot rationally be ſuppoſed to command us to refuſe obedience to the injunctions of <hi>Superiors</hi> for that end. And this doth plainly follow from what St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. For therefore he requires the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to abſtain from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things offered to Idols, when that would prove a Scandal to the weak, becauſe by eating they were <hi>not the better,</hi> or not more acceptable to God, and by abſtaining from it, they were <hi>not the worſe,</hi> whence we may rationally infer that when the doing of an action will commend us to God, as our obedience to <hi>Gods Vice-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> in all lawful matters moſt certainly will do, and when the neglecting of an action will render us the worſe, as the neglect of that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which God in Scripture hath required will
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107117:129"/>do, there we are not obliged to refrain the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that action, tho it may miniſter unto the Scandal of our weaker Brother, becauſe we muſt not do evil that good may come.</p>
            <p>Moreover in matters of this Nature we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſobey but we muſt miniſter occaſion of far greater Scandal by our diſobedience than we can do by our ſubmiſſion to the command of our <hi>Superiors;</hi> as I have ſhewed already. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By diſobedience to our <hi>Superiors</hi> in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matters we give occaſion to others to traduce the Goſpel, by repreſenting it as that which teacheth <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to refuſe obedience to the commands of their <hi>Superiors</hi> in Lawful matters.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, We provoke <hi>Superiors</hi> to puniſh this our diſobedience; now either we deſerve that puniſhment, or not; if we deſerve it we muſt confeſs that we are evil doers by not affording this Submiſſion to the commands of our <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,</hi> and therefore cannot truly Plead the Scandal of the weak for our juſtification in ſo doing; if we deſerve it not, then do we give occaſion to the ſin of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in puniſhing us unjuſtly, and ſo have the ſame reaſon to avoid their Scandal.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, By diſobedience to our <hi>Superiors</hi> in theſe matters we provoke others to judge, cenſure, and condemn us as diſobedient and ſeditious Perſons. Now either they do judge aright, when they do paſs this ſentence on us, and then we muſt be truly diſobedient, and therefore ſinful in our refuſal to ſubmit to the injunctions of Authority in Lawful matters, or they do judge amiſs, and ſo we give occaſion to their ſin, and therefore truly Scandalize them by our diſobedience.

            <p n="1">1. That ſince ſome poſture is then neceſſary, and none by God determined, it cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be doubted but that the <hi>Church</hi> hath power to determine in this matter as ſhe conceives moſt proper and convenient.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, I know no poſture more convenient than that of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> it being a very fit expreſſion of our humility, and of the ſenſe of our unworthineſs of the great bleſſings there received.

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:107117:133"/>3ly, I add, That if it be lawful to receive in ſuch a humble poſture, then muſt it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to refuſe Communion with our <hi>Church</hi> in the participation of this Ordinance, becauſe ſhe doth require us to uſe this poſture in receiving. For on this ſuppoſition, we muſt refuſe to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her in a lawful matter, and ſo muſt ſeparate from her communion in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance without cauſe, which is the ſin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> Now that it is lawful to receive Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will appear by anſwering the Arguments produced by <hi>Diſſenters</hi> againſt this poſture. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is objected, That
<q>Kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is contrary to the Practice and Example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for they received ſitting.</q>

               </label> It is to be lamented that ſuch falſe, Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and frivolous ſuggeſtions as theſe are, ſhould keep men from Communion with their Brethren in this Holy Ordinance; for 1. The matter of fact is in this Argument Extreamly falſe, it being not the Sight of the Elements which doth induce us then to Kneel: But we receive them Kneeling, ſaith our <hi>Lyturgy, <note place="margin">Rubr. after the Commun.</note> for a ſignification of our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgment of the benefits of Chriſt there tendred,</hi> and becauſe Kneeling is a proper po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to tender our devotion in. The Elements do only bring theſe things to our remembrance, they do it to our eyes, as the words uſed in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Prayer Book, or by the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> do bring them to remembrance by our hearing; if then it be Idolatry to worſhip God when theſe things by the Symbols are brought to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, it muſt be ſo to worſhip God when we do hear a Sermon, Prayer, or a diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. 2ly. If this be Idolatry, then our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> muſt be Groſs <hi>Idolaters,</hi> for Surely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip, unduly tendred, is as Groſs <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> as outward worſhip by which it is expreſs'd; now do not they, when they behold the bread broken, and the wine poured out, put forth an act of inward worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> an act of praiſe, thankſgiving, love, affiance? do they not do this before a creature as much as we? are not the Elements ſeen by them the motive of their doing ſo as much as of our Kneeling? If then we are Idolaters for Kneeling to God before them, why
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107117:134"/>muſt not they be equally Idolaters by tendring all this inward worſhip to him before, and on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame Elements. 3ly, Were this Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt be Idolaters by worſhipping the Lord <hi>before the Ark</hi> or <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> before the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and before the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> for by ſo doing they worſhipped God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a creature, and would not have done ſo, had they not been before theſe creatures, ſince the command runs thus to worſhip him, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſ.</hi> 99.5, 9.</note> and <hi>to fall down before his footſtool;</hi> moreover how often do we find them falling down and worſhipping at the appearance of that <hi>cloud,</hi> or fire which was the Symbol of Gods preſence? <hi>When they ſaw the fire fall and conſume the burnt offerings, they fell upon their faces.</hi> 1 Kings 18 38, 39. <hi>When they ſaw the fire of God come down, and the Glory of the Lord upon the houſe, they bowed themſelves with their faces to the Ground,</hi> 2 Chron. 7.3. And yet becauſe they did this not to the cloud, or fire, but to God, there could be no <hi>Idolatry</hi> in this their action. 4ly, It is a thing impoſſible that ſuch an action as this is ſhould any ways be Guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for <hi>Idolatry is falſe worſhip of a creature,</hi> now where there is no worſhip of the creature, as in this action there is not, there can be no falſe worſhip of the creature. And to evidence to every rational Capacity, that nothing uſed in the Service of our <hi>Church</hi> can rationally be charged with any ſemblance of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and manifeſt the great and ſignal difference there is betwixt the actions of our <hi>Church</hi> which our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> call <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and thoſe which in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> we do accuſe as ſuch, I lay down this diſtinction, <hi>viz:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may Kneel, bow down, or may perform like acts of outward worſhip before any
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107117:135"/>creature, either ſo as to make that creature only the circumſtance, or the occaſion of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or elſe ſo as to make that creature the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thoſe acts of worſhip. When any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is rendred the object of our worſhip, the mind doth actually, or virtually intend to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or pay an act of Reverence to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is thus made the object of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but when the Creature is only made the Circumſtance, or the occaſion of the worſhip, the mind intends to pay the act of worſhip only to another object, in ſuch a place, or upon intimation, or apprehenſion of the object which I worſhip, which apprehenſion or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is cauſed by that Creature. Thus when I come to Common Prayer read in the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> is the circumſtance of place, the hour, of time, for the performance of that worſhip, but God is the ſole object of it, when at the hearing of the <hi>Ave Mary Bell,</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> begins his <hi>Ave Mary,</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> is the object, the Bell is only the occaſion of it, and when they then Kneel down, and bow, they do not Kneel unto the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated <hi>Bell,</hi> but to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly, This being ſo, it is ridiculous to ſay we worſhip any thing, becauſe it is before us when we direct our outward worſhip to another object. Since on the ſame account the <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Eaſt</hi> who worſhip'd <hi>Chriſt</hi> before the <hi>Manger,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to pay their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the <hi>Manger,</hi> and they who meeting <hi>Chriſt Riding upon an Aſs,</hi> Saluted him with their <hi>Hoſannas,</hi> and bowed towards him, muſt alſo pay their worſhip to the <hi>Aſs.</hi> And if upon appearance of the <hi>Devil</hi> we ſhould fall upon our Knees, and beg of God to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107117:135"/>from him, we muſt be ſaid to worſhip the very <hi>Devil</hi> by that action. Moreover when we lift up our eyes, and voices to the <hi>Heavens,</hi> we alſo lift them up towards the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> but will it follow thence that by ſo doing we do not only worſhip God, but the Material Heavens, and thoſe Glorious lights we ſee, as was objected by the <hi>Pagans</hi> againſt the People of the <hi>Jews?</hi> Wherefore to ſay that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> worſhip the <hi>Altar,</hi> or the <hi>Euchariſtick Elements,</hi> becauſe they worſhip God before them, is to calumniate the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as antiently the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> did the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> affirming that they worſhipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe they worſhipped God <hi>toward the Eaſt,</hi> and ſo by conſequence towards the <hi>Riſing Sun.</hi> Wherefore to give a clear and Satisfactory Anſwer to all the inſtances of this nature, which are alledged by <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to prove the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Guilty of this crime, I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when we bow towards the <hi>Altar,</hi> as we enter into, or come out of the <hi>Church, Chancel,</hi> or <hi>Chappel,</hi> where we worſhip God, the <hi>Altar</hi> is not the object of our worſhip, but only an accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of it, for we do not in the leaſt intend by this obeyſance to do an act of worſhip to the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table,</hi> or any thing placed there, or elſewhere, but to God alone, for this the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath ſolemnly declared in theſe words: <note place="margin">

               <hi>Whereas the Church is the houſe of God dedicated to his Holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and therefore ought to mind us both of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs of his Divine Majeſty, certain it is that the acknowledgment thereof, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in our hearts, but alſo outwardly with our bodies, muſt needs be pious in it ſelf, profitable to us, and Edifying to others; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it very meet and behoveful, and heartily commend it to all good and well affected
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107117:136"/>People, Members of this Church, that they be ready to tender to the Lord the ſaid acknowledgment, by doing reverence and obeiſance both at their coming in, and going out of the ſaid Churches, Chancels, or Chappels, according to the moſt Ancient Cuſtom of the Primitive Church in the pureſt times, and of this Church alſo for many years in the Reign of Queen</hi> Elizabeth. <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving therefore of this Ancient and laudable Cuſtom, we heartily commend to the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all good People, not with any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to exhibit any Religious Worſhip to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table, the Eaſt, or Church, or any thing contained therein in ſo doing, or to perform the ſaid geſture in Celebration of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt upon any opinion of a Corporal Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt on the Holy Table, or in the Myſtical Elements, but only for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods Majeſty, and to give him Alone that honor and glory which is due unto him, and no otherwiſe.</hi> Which <hi>Canon</hi> as it declares this act of Worſhip not to be given, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Altar,</hi> ſo doth it give us the true Reaſon why it is accidentally done towards the <hi>Altar;</hi> viz. Becauſe it is performed at our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the immediate place of Worſhip, to which entrance the <hi>Altar</hi> ſtandeth oppoſite.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, When at the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> we are wont to bow, that bowing is not intended by us to the very <hi>name,</hi> which is the occaſion only of the Worſhip by putting us in mind of him that is named, and of our higheſt obligation to him, as being <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> to whom therefore we addreſs our ſelves, and recognize him as our only <hi>Saviour</hi> by that eſpecial and peculiar act of devotion. So that the adoration then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed is wholly and abſolutely directed to the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107117:136"/>
               <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> as is declared by the <hi>Church</hi> in theſe words: <note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3ly, When we Kneel at the Reception of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rubrick after the Communion</note> we do not pay that outward act of Worſhip to the <hi>Elements of Bread and Wine,</hi> but to that <hi>Savior</hi> whom they repreſent; for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath declared that <hi>thereby no adoration is intended, or ought to be done unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine there bodily received.</hi> So that from the expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> it appears, that none of theſe things are by her made the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> but only the occaſions of tendring that Worſhip which we owe to <hi>God,</hi> and therefore there is no appearance of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in the performance of theſe things.</p>

            <p>Laſtly this Text only engages <hi>Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> to ſeparate from perſons Guilty of ſuch crimes, as to familiar converſe in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, but never to decline their preſence ſo as to neglect the doing or receiving good to their own ſouls or bodies. For 1. <hi>Divines</hi> agree in this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> do not in this, or other places, preſcribe ſuch ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is injurious to any, or takes off any duties which by the law of nature we do owe unto them, or our Relation to them calls for. A <hi>Wife</hi> muſt not, by virtue of this Precept, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from her ungodly <hi>Husband,</hi> no, tho he be an unbeliever, <hi>let her not leave him,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.15.

If then this Precept will not oblige us to perform what is injurious to anothers temporals, it cannot lay upon us an obligation to do that which is prejudicial to our own Spiritual concerns: Much leſs what prejudicieth the concernments of the <hi>Church,</hi> our Spiritual Mother, and makes us diſobedient to our <hi>Spiritual Fathers.</hi> 2ly, This Precept doth not bind in caſe of ſignal damage, for I am not obliged to renounce his Company by whom my Trade is carried on, my goods go off, becauſe I judge him wicked or Profane,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107117:139"/>or to refuſe a Cuſtomer becauſe he is no <hi>Saint,</hi> for then no Trade could lawfully be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and there would be no living in the world. I do not mean, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> to for bid your keeping Company, as your occaſions ſerve, with the Fornicators, Covetous, Idolaters of the world, for then you muſt go out of the world, <hi>v.</hi> 9.10. If then, as far as the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our worldly callings warrant us, we may enjoy their Company, much more when this is neceſſary to the concernments of our Souls, or our Spiritual Callings. 3ly, When I am called as a Gueſt, where accidentally I meet with ſuch a one, I am not then obliged to depart, and leave the Company becauſe I find him there, for this can be no evidence of my familiarity with him: Much leſs am I obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to depart on his account, when I am gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly invited to this heavenly banquet, and call'd to feaſt upon the Supper of the Lamb. And 4ly, Our Lord did, notwithſtanding this duty of avoiding the Company of wicked men, familiarly converſe with <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> in order to their reformation and ſpiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, <note place="margin">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107117:139"/>to our <hi>Church,</hi> and whether any ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her can be juſtified on this account. And therfore I aſſert,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Secluding of profane and wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who after admonition by the Church, <note place="margin">

<q>Reaſons to break off private familiarity, which will not hold as to Publick Communion, and which may render it the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> duty to do the firſt, and not the latter.

               <hi>That the continuance of Gods preſence by his Spirit with his Church, and her Aſſemblies, cannot be proved to depend entirely upon the Separation of wicked Perſons, and ſcandalous offenders from her.</hi> The Place produced to this Effect from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17. only concerns the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Separation from Communion with <hi>Heathens</hi> in their <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip,</hi> or their <hi>Idol feaſts,</hi> this is <hi>the touching the unclean thing</hi> there ſpoken of, as I have fully proved in the foregoing Chapters; it therefore is impertinently alledged to prove, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to ſeparate from the Communion of wicked Perſons in celebrating of his Publick worſhip, that ſo we may enjoy the preſence of his Spirit with us. Moreover God may deſtroy the perſon who defiles this <hi>Temple</hi> as he threatens 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. and yet may not withdraw his Spirit from them that do aſſemble with ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons purely to ſerve God, and to enjoy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in his Publick Ordinances. And indeed were this ſo that the preſence of a known wicked Perſon would cauſe the Holy Spirit to depart from the Aſſemblies of pious Perſons, then <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> had not the preſence of the holy Spirit with them when they aſſembled with <hi>Judas</hi> to eat the paſſover,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107117:155"/>and to receive the holy Sacrament. 2ly, Then ſeeing Covetous, malitious Perſons, ſince ſecret <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> are as odious to God as Perſons otherwiſe notoriouſly wicked and profane, they alſo muſt pollute the <hi>Church,</hi> and cauſe the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> to depart from her <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> and if ſo the <hi>Church</hi> can never be aſſured of his preſence with her. Then 3ly, much leſs would the holy Spirit be preſent at thoſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices deſigned to conveigh this Spirit, when they were celebrated by <hi>wicked Prieſts,</hi> and ſo we could have no aſſurance of his gracious influence upon us at the preaching of the Word, the celebration of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and of the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord, becauſe we can have no aſſurance of the ſincerity of him who doth officiate. For if the preſence of wicked Perſons who do only joyn with the <hi>Officiator,</hi> will cauſe the holy Spirit to depart from that <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> much more the wickedneſs of the <hi>Officiator.</hi> And 4ly, then we muſt have cauſe to fear that this good Spirit hath wholly left the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, and doth no longer move upon <hi>the waters of the Sanctuary,</hi> there being in theſe latter Ages of the <hi>Church</hi> ſuch a neglect of Diſcipline, as that ſcarce any one of her Aſſemblies can be ſuppoſed free from ſome mixture of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and even notorious wicked Perſons, which yet ſeems plainly to contradict Chriſt's promiſe <hi>to be with his Church unto the end.</hi>

<q>That to teſtifie God's gracious acceptance, either by our words or actions, of mens undertaking the exerciſe of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is a thing greatly different from the tendering the Divine Grace of God's cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as exhibited by any Sign, as a means to convey the ſame, which is the Proper nature of a Sacrament, which is very true.</q> But then 'tis very difficult to apprehend how any Perſon can certifie another of God's grace and favour to him by ſuch a Sign which is no means of tendring, or of conveighing of the ſame, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if God hath no where ſaid that ſuch a Sign ſhall ſignifie or certifie this favour to us.</p>

Ainſworth</hi> upon theſe words <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.27. <hi>And they ſhall put my name upon the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I will bleſs them,</hi> writes thus, <hi>It ſeems to be meant of the Prieſts Geſture, that they ſhould lift their hands towards his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as did</hi> Aaron, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9.22. <hi>for a Sign that the name, and Bleſſing of God was impoſed upon them,</hi> And <hi>Maſius,</hi> out of <hi>Junius,</hi> doth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus upon the Text. <hi>Duobus Signis ſolitis teſtatum facient Populo gratiam meam, nominis mei invocatione, &amp; manuum ſuarum impoſitione publica &amp; ſolenni: By two vſual Signs they ſhall teſtifie my favour to the People, viz.

If Hands were by Gods inſtitution, the practiſe of our Lord, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> impoſed in teſtimony of Gods help, favor and grace to be given to him, on whom they were impoſed, why not to certifie what they do teſtifie?

Whence it muſt follow, that all theſe Signs of outward Worſhip are due to him, and that we rob him of his honor by our neglect to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:107117:161"/>pay them to him, as well as by our giving them to any thing beſides him. And ſutably to this Command our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth inform us, that this Worſhip is ſtill due to God, and to him only; for being tempted by the Devil <hi>to fall down and Worſhip him,</hi> he gives this reaſon why He could not do it, <note place="margin">

Even before the Law the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did from the light of nature tender this Worſhip to God: When <hi>Lot</hi> beheld the <hi>Angel</hi> who repreſented God, <note place="margin">

               <hi>he bowed his knee to the Ground,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.2. Thus did his ſervant Worſhip God, and when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had heard that the Lord had look'd upon their affliction, <hi>they bowed their heads, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.31.</note> and Worſhipped;</hi> this was a thing ſo conſtantly performed by them, that <hi>to bow down,</hi> is in the Hebrew phraſe, <hi>to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: We will go yonder and bow down,</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:107117:161"/>that is, <hi>will Worſhip,</hi> Gen. 22.5. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that we might not think that this was any part of <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Worſhip, it is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon eternal Grounds of Reaſon, <hi>Let us bow down before his footſtool, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.5, 9.</note> for the Lord our God is Holy.</hi> And doth not Reaſon tell us that God is more worthy to be reverenced and honored than the chiefeſt of his creatures, and that we have far greater reaſon, becauſe of the vaſt diſtance that there is betwixt us and him, to come into his preſence in an humble manner. Sith then we do perform theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of reverence to our <hi>Superiors</hi> on earth in token of the honor which we owe to them, much more ought we to do ſo to the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Hence then it naturally follows, <note place="margin">Coroll.</note> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is a proper act of outward Worſhip, and fitly doth expreſs our inward Reverence of God by any outward geſture of the body, may very laudably be required by <hi>Superiors,</hi> ſeeing by theſe injunctions they only do require us to do in this or that particular what is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral our duty.

            <p>To require us to do this at the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> rather than at the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Saviour,</hi> when we deſign to recognize him as our only Saviour by that act of worſhip, ſeems alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſeeing the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth rather ſignifie his unction to his office than the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which accrue unto us by the execution of it.

            <p>THE Ceremonies required by the <hi>Church</hi> being own'd as lawful, and her <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals</hi> approved as ſuch, no Exceptions can be farther made againſt Communion with her, beſides thoſe which do concern her <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and thoſe I ſhall conſider in handling theſe two Propoſitions,</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>1</label> 1. Becauſe ſuch a <hi>Liturgy</hi> is not forbidden in the Word of God; now <hi>Sin being the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law,</hi> there can be no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in doing that which is forbidden by no Law. Moreover, where there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107117:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>there is no duty, and therefore no tranſgreſſion by neglect of Duty, but holy <hi>Scripture</hi> doth afford no Precept commanding us to Pray without a Form, and therefore we cannot tranſgreſs by the neglect of Duty, though we do not ſo Pray.</p>
            <p>Now that a ſtinted <hi>Liturgy</hi> is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, needs no other proof than this, that no ſuch prohibition can be ſhewed from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi> but yet, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> I thus argue, that which is not ſorbidden in general, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Precept which commands us, <hi>not to add unto the word of God,</hi> nor in particular by any Precept which in words direct, or conſequential, forbid us, when we Pray, to uſe a form, is not at all forbid. But thus it is with reference to a <hi>ſtinted Liturgy,</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>And 1. That the uſe of ſtinted Forms of Prayer, not preſcribed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by virtue of this Precept, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>not to add unto the word of God,</hi> is evident,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the expoſition I have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of thoſe words.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Becauſe no reaſon can be given, why praying by a Form ſhould be eſteemed <hi>adding to the word of God,</hi> rather than Praying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Form; God having in the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> commanded Prayer by Form, but never Prayer without it.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, The <hi>Jews</hi> to whom this prohibition of <hi>adding to the Word</hi> was given, did, as I have obſerved from Dr. <hi>Leightfoot,</hi> and as the Learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> hath informed us, <note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">In Mat. 6.9.</note> by all which conſiderations, it is evident that they conceived not ſuch Forms forbidden by the prohibition, <hi>to add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of God.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, <hi>John</hi> taught his <hi>Diſciples</hi> a Form of Prayer, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only joined with the Forms which were appointed to be uſed in the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> but did himſelf preſcribe a Form of Prayer for his <hi>Diſciples;</hi> by all which inſtances, it is demonſtratively evident that Forms of Prayer were not forbidden by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Precepts commanding the <hi>Jews not to add unto the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly, That there is no eſpecial Precept in the <hi>Old,</hi> or the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which doth in words direct or conſequential forbid the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> when he prays, to uſe a Form, will be apparent from an impartial conſideration of what is offered from Scripture, by way of objection againſt the uſe of Forms, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are contrary to Scripture, Precept, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Example.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Scripture Precept, for that, ſay

But,</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, If by praying <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> we are to underſtand praying by that <hi>Spiritual Gift,</hi> which was vouchſaſed to ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days, by which they were enabled by the immediate, and the miraculous aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, to indite, or uſe ſuch Prayers as ſuted to the wants of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe times, as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> think: Let it be then obſerved, that theſe miraculous Gifts being now ceaſed, we are no more concerned in theſe Precepts, than we are to <hi>anoint the ſick with oil,</hi> when we pray over them according to the preſcription of St. <hi>James.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">James 5.14.</note> Now that theſe Gifts are ceaſed, and that no man can

            <p n="1">1. That were this otherwiſe, our Prayers would be of Divine Inſpiration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Canonical</hi> as Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> and as fit to be preſerved as a Guide or Rule of Faith, or at the leaſt, of Prayer; which yet <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have not the confidence to ſay.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Then alſo the ſame Perſons may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>ſing,</hi> and <hi>Propheſie,</hi> and <hi>Preach</hi> by the miraculous, and the immediate aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> for where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of praying by this Gift of the Good Spirit, he alſo ſpeaketh of <hi>Singing</hi> and <hi>Propheſying by the Spirit,</hi> whereas <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have not the conſidence to pretend unto the latter, and therefore have no reaſon to lay claim unto the former.

            <p>Laſtly, Whereas it is objected,
<q>That in ſet Forms of prayer we reſtrain and confine the Spirit, and in conceived prayers the Spirit is free, unlimited, and unconſtrained.</q> I Anſwer, That by <hi>reſtraining of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Objectors</hi> mean the <hi>reſtraining</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or of the <hi>bleſſed</hi> Spirit: If by reſtraining of the Spirit they mean <hi>reſtraining the ſpirit of the Miniſter,</hi> I ask,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>Why his Spirit may not be reſtrained by the wiſdom of his <hi>Superiors,</hi> as well as the ſpirit of the people by his conceived prayer?

               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:107117:179"/>2. <q>Did not Chriſt reſtrain the Spirit of his own <hi>Diſciples</hi> when he taught them to pray the <hi>Lords Prayer?</hi> if he had only ſaid <hi>pray thus, after this manner,</hi> and given only a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> for the matter of prayer, this was a reſtraint: but if he ſaid, <hi>pray this,</hi> or <hi>pray theſe words,</hi> as I ſhall prove he did, he then preſcribed both the matter and words too; and therefore did reſtrain the Spirit of his <hi>Diſciples</hi> as truly as any other form could do.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <q>The Spirit of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> muſt in ſome caſes be reſtrained, and that by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> for otherwiſe what means S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> when he preſcribed orders for <hi>publick Propheſying,</hi> and <hi>Interpretation,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking with Tongues.</hi> All theſe are Anſwers to this Objection tranſcribed from the <hi>excellent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Taylors</hi> Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Prayer ex

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If by the Spirit, they mean the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> I enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>By what Argument ſhall any man make it ſo much as probable, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is injured, if every private Miniſters Spirit ſhall be guided, and ſo by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence limited by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> What prohibition, what Law, what Reaſon, or Revelation is againſt it, what inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the nature of the thing? for can any man be ſo weak as to imagine a deſpite is done to the Spirit of Grace, when men pray by ſuch well compoſed Forms as the whole <hi>Church</hi> approves of, and doth not, in oppoſition to them, uſe his private Gift? 2. Is not the Holy Spirit as much reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by premeditated prayers, ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of that premeditation is only to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after what form, or manner, they ſhould pray, for what, and in what words, ſo that the <hi>Holy Spirits</hi> aſſiſtance is reſtrained to their conceptions and meditations; men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be bound to pray they know not what, or elſe, according to this Objection, muſt lay reſtraints upon the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> 3. Doth not the <hi>Directory</hi> that thing which is here called reſtraining of the Spirit? Doth it not appoint every thing but the words, and after this, is it not a goodly <hi>Palladium</hi> which is contended for, and a princely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they leave unto the Spirit, to be free only in ſupplying the place of a <hi>Vocabulary,</hi> or a <hi>Copia Verborum,</hi> for as for the matter it is all there deſcribed and appointed, and to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107117:180"/>theſe determinate ſenſes the Spirit muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, or not at all, only for the words he ſhall take his choice. Now I enquire, which is the moſt conſiderable of the two, Senſe or Language, matter or words? if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is it not a greater injury to the Spirit to reſtrain his matter, than to appoint his words; ſo that in the greater of the two the Spirit is reſtrained when his matter is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and to make him amends for not truſting him with the matter without our directions and limitations, we truſt him to ſay what he pleaſeth, ſo it be to our ſenſe. 4. Is it not as much a reſtraint of the Spirit to ſing a Pſalm in Metre by appointment, as to uſe a Form of Prayer and Thankſgiving by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment? &amp; yet this is done daily by <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> without any ſcruple made, which ſeems to argue great partiality, or want of judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There being then no Scripture precept, no evidence of reaſon againſt Forms of prayer, we may hence rationally conclude that they are lawful; For had it been the will of God that publick prayers ſhould be performed by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> in an extemporary manner, and not by forms, we may rationally conceive the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of ſupplication, would ſomewhere have admoniſhed us to pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and to beware of Book-prayers and the uſe of Forms, as well as of neglecting this duty altogether, or performing it in a careleſs and undue manner; and this the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Forms of Prayer and Thankſgiving were uſed in the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> and becauſe the modeſty of many good <hi>Christians,</hi> and the inabilities of many more would naturally prompt them to the uſe of ſo ready a help
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107117:181"/>to Devotion as pious and uſeful Forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are, but ſo far are we from finding any command in <hi>Scripture</hi> to pray upon ſuddain invention, that we find no preference given to this way in <hi>Scripture</hi> above the uſe of Forms, but rather the contrary, for when our <hi>Saviour</hi> taught his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to pray, he enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the uſe of a form. As for all other vices by which this duty is corrupted, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leſs acceptable to God, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath fully cautioned us againſt them, <note place="margin">Matt. 6.7. v. 5. Matt. 15.8. Luke 18.10. 1 Cor. 14. James 1.6. 1 Tim. 2.8.

Again our <hi>Lord</hi> approved of a Form of prayer, by his uſing the Hymn called the <hi>Hallel</hi> with his <hi>Diſciples</hi> at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matt. 26.30.</note>

            <p n="2">2. Hence it muſt follow that the uſing of a Form can be no hindrance to our <hi>Devotion, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, fervency in prayer,</hi> unleſs our <hi>Lord</hi> can be ſuppoſed to have preſcribed that which was thus prejudicial to his Service.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107117:184"/>will be needful to advertiſe them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all premeditated Prayer in which we do conſider what to ſay, and in what words we ſhould expreſs our thoughts to God, is in effect a ſtinted prayer; for it is not the Writing, or the Printing, but the ordering and compoſing of the words which makes the Prayer a Form: if therefore this be be done before we pray, our prayer muſt be a Form.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This being ſo, the true ſtate of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> can be only this, whether in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the moſt immenſe, infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, we ſhould uſe conſideration, or pray and praiſe him inconſiderately? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould deliberate, and take good heed that we offend not with our tongues, or ſpeak without deliberation whatſoever cometh firſt into our thoughts? <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.2.</note> Whether we ſhould <hi>take unto our ſelves words, and ſpeak unto him,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Hoſeah</hi> doth adviſe; or ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſelves before him not knowing what to ſay? And for our better ſatisfaction the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> doth adviſe us, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.2.</note> 
               <hi>not to be raſh with our mouths, nor let our hearts be hasty to utter any thing before God;</hi> and that for an eternal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>God is in Heaven and we are on Earth.</hi> Now what man in the world is <hi>hasty to offer any thing before God,</hi> if he be not, who prays <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or who ſpeaks <hi>raſhly with his mouth,</hi> if he doth not who ſpeaks without deliberation or conſideration what to ſay? Secondly, our own experience will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us how natural it is to all mankind to take ſuch good advice before hand, when they preſent their thanks, or their petitions to an <hi>Earthly Prince,</hi> as may ſecure them that they deliver their requeſts in grave and decent
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107117:184"/>Forms of words; and can it therefore ſtand with the reverence we owe to the moſt <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty</hi> of Heaven and Earth, to uſe to him what we durſt not preſent unto a <hi>Prince</hi> or prudent <hi>Governour,</hi> in ſuch a ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as ought to be the ſubject of our Prayers? This is the Argument by which God pleads againſt the lame and the imperfect ſacrifices of his people, ſaying, <hi>if ye offer the blind for ſacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and ſick, is it not evil? <note place="margin">Mal. 1.8.</note> offer it now unto thy Governour, will he be pleaſed with thee, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thy perſon?</hi> implying that the great King of Heaven and Earth muſt be ſerved with the beſt ſacrifices we can tender to him, and therefore with the beſt prayers and praiſes which we can conceive; and that what earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Princes</hi> may ſlight as beneath them, muſt be unworthy to be offered to the King of Kings. Moreover, if we compare together both theſe kinds of prayer by Form, and by extemporary effuſions, we ſhall find the former to be more expedient in our publick Worſhip, for ſeveral momentous reaſons concerning both our ſelves and others. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth require us, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.15.</note> and even reaſon doth inform us, that we ſhould <hi>pray with the underſtanding,</hi> and that we cannot ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to that Prayer we underſtand not; now what aſſurance can the people have in joining with a <hi>Miniſter</hi> who prays <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and oft in <hi>myſtical</hi> expreſſions of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that he ſhall underſtand the meaning of his words? whereas, if conſtant <hi>Liturgies</hi> be uſed, we may be well aſſured, by our own reading, or by the information of others, of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:107117:185"/>2ly, The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intimates, that 'tis the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the hearer to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the Prayers offered up in publick, and indeed otherwiſe we cannot well be ſaid to join with the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> in Prayer; now this we cannot do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, unleſs we do approve the matter of the Prayer; now what aſſurance can the people have, in that great difference of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and opinions that there is among us, and that great liberty men take to vent their private ſentiments in Prayer, when they are not reſtrained, that they ſhall honeſtly be able to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to a conceived Prayer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a ſet Form of <hi>Liturgy</hi> this inconvenience is avoided, ſeeing we know before hand, to what we are to ſay <hi>Amen;</hi> and therefore if we do not like it, may abſent our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, How can we ſollicite any perſons, or perſwade any ſtrangers to come to our <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> or join in Communion with us, where we cannot promiſe them that the Devotions to be uſed there ſhall be innocent; we cannot ſhew them how we worſhip God, and thereby put them in a condition to judge for themſelves, or promiſe them, as in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> they might, whilſt prayer by the Spirit laſted, that all our prayers ſhall be agreeable unto the mind of God; or how can this be done without producing ſome preſcribed Form by which we pray. This ſeems to be one reaſon why all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the World have had their publick Forms of prayer, that they might let every-body know how God is ſerved by them. And why the beſt men in the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches</hi> have wiſhed thoſe happy days might come, <note place="margin">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107117:185"/>and all her members with one heart and mouth might glorify God, that ſo the unity of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and charity among Believers, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as far as may be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4ly, By ſet Forms many miſchiefs are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to which conceived prayer doth ſtand obnoxious; for hereby care is taken, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, through the ignorance of ſome, or the negligence of others, ſhould be offered up to God, which is contrary to the Faith, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his <hi>Divine Majeſty;</hi> on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it was long ſince reſolved by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levitan Council, <note place="margin">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107117:186"/>may be better ſaid to <hi>glorify God with one mouth,</hi> than by the great variety of prayers conceived; and ſo the uſe of well compoſed Forms in publick Worſhip, are upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be preferred before extemporary effuſions. And,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To confeſs my own infirmities, I find one great advantage in a form of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that being naturally thoughtful and apt to make deductions from what I read or hear, I very often make ſome obſervations from the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and Leſſons of the day, as I attend unto them, and my thoughts eagerly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, my Devotions are too often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with wandring thoughts, which though they may be pious in themſelves, yet muſt be my infirmities, as far as they withdraw my heart from diligent attention to the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then put up to God: Now when this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to me, whilſt others are uſing their conceived prayers, I know not what are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires I have neglected, and ſo I cannot, when I recal my ſelf, offer up thoſe deſires to God, begging his pardon for my wandrings; but when I find my thoughts thus wandring in any part of the <hi>Church Service,</hi> I preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect where they began to wander, what the petitions were which thus eſcaped me; and either preſently, if I have any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or when I make up my accounts with God in my retirements, I humbly offer them up to God, beſeeching his forgiveneſs of my wandring thoughts. This to me ſeems a kind of ſatisfaction made to my good God, and is a ſatisfaction to my mind; and therefore whatſoever others may think of it, it ſeems to me no ſmall advantage of a Form above a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107117:186"/>new conceived prayer, though no man that I know of hath taken any notice of it; ſince therefore by the uſe of Forms we may beſt pray with underſtanding, and more ſecurely and aſſuredly may join with him that doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to his petitions; ſince hereby others may be aſſured beforehand, that they can join ſincerely with us in the publick ſervice, and may particularly prepare their hearts beforehand ſo to do. Seeing hereby the benefit which is promiſed to the <hi>Church,</hi> from the <hi>Symphony</hi> of her petitions is beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and both people and <hi>Miniſters</hi> may be relieved beſt againſt their various diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and ſeeing hereby all unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcandalous expreſſions, which diſturb the moſt devout, and miniſter occaſion of deriſion to the looſer <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> are, in the moſt conſiderable and ſolemn parts of Divine Worſhip beſt prevented; ſeeing a Form may be uſed, no probability of any prohibition of them being made apparent, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtand bound to yield obedience to their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors</hi> in lawful matters; ſeeing a Form muſt be uſed in our publick Prayers, by virtue of our <hi>Lords</hi> command, to ſay <hi>Our Father,</hi> and in our publick <hi>Hymns</hi> and Pſalmody, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our inability to conceive them ſuddenly; and laſtly, ſeeing the whole Church of God, hath conſtantly uſed Forms in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of her publick ſervice, for thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years; upon all theſe accounts, I think it is highy convenient, that they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Church</hi> of God, eſpecially if we conſider that our <hi>Church</hi> doth not wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the uſe of any <hi>Miniſters</hi> pretended gift in this kind, but gives him liberty to uſe it

            <p n="8">8. The Prayer to be ſaid during the time of <hi>Advent,</hi> is, that we <hi>may caſt away the works of darkneſs, and put upon us the armor of light:</hi> the Prayer to be ſaid every day in <hi>Lent,</hi> begs, that God would <hi>create and make in us new and contrite hearts.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Church</hi> hath appointed her Office of <hi>Commination</hi> on purpoſe to awaken ſuch notorious Sinners to Repentance. Let therefore any reaſonable perſon judge whether there be <hi>no Petition or Confeſſion in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, which imports any doubt, or fear, that any who join in our Service may be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate?</hi> whether there be <hi>no Prayer made to the Lord with ſpecial relation to ſuch perſons?</hi> or whether <hi>the whole phraſe of all our Offices be ſuch as preſumes all perſons within the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church to be regenerate,</hi> as is ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and whether it be not matter of juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that ſuch exceptions as are ſo groſly, and manifoldly falſe, ſhould with ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be made againſt our <hi>Liturgy.</hi>

Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>O Lord I beſeech thee let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy ſervants who deſire to fear thy name,</hi> Neh. 1.11. which is as much as this, <hi>to whom thou haſt given a hearty deſire to pray.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> prayeth thus, concerning a people as prone to truſt in their own righteouſneſs as others are, <hi>we do not preſent our ſupplications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee for our righteouſneſs, but for thy great mercies,</hi> Dan. 9.18. It therefore may not be denied but that in mixt Congregations men may be ſaid to do what they do outwardly profeſs, and inwardly ſtand bound to do, and many of them truly in ſome good meaſure do. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> declares, that it is better <hi>to go to the houſe of mourning than of feasting, for this
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107117:199"/>is the end of all men, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.2.</note> and the living will lay it to heart;</hi> and yet alas how few do ſo indeed? And God doth by his own Example teach us to judge thus charitably, for having ſent his Son unto the <hi>Jews,</hi>
